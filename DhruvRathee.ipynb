text='Hello, friends!\\n16th August, 1945.\\nWorld War II was on the verge of ending.\\nJapan had laid down their weapons and surrendered.\\nAnd in Germany, Hitler took his own life.\\nGermany and Japan, both countries\\nhad lost this war terribly.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose,\\nwho was taking Japan\\'s help to \\nlead the Indian National Army since 1943,\\nwas looking for new ways\\nto continue the freedom struggle.\\nEven though the plans weren\\'t properly laid out,\\nhis associates knew that\\nNetaji wanted to shift his base into the Soviet Union.\\nHis plan was to first go to Tokyo\\nto thank the Japanese Government\\nand leave for Soviet from there.\\nThe reason for this was very simple.\\nThe Soviet Union was a part of the Allied Forces.\\nThe countries that won this war.\\nBut despite this, the Soviet was\\nideologically different from other \\nallied countries like the US and the UK.\\nDue to his Communist ideology, Netaji hoped\\nthat they would help India \\nin our fight against the British.\\nBut the problem was that \\nJapan\\'s loss was still fresh.\\nAnd there had been two nuclear \\nattacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nSo there weren\\'t many options for Netaji to travel to Tokyo.\\nThe Japanese forces found a way for him to travel\\nthat looked like this.\\nHe would board a Mitsubishi \\nKi-21 Heavy Bomber aircraft,\\nthat would take off from Saigon in Vietnam.\\nThis aircraft would make a stop in Taiwan\\'s Heito,\\nfrom there, it would fly to Taihoku Prefecture\\npresent-day Taipei in Taiwan.\\nAnd then one last stop in China\\'s Manchuria territory,\\nbefore finally reaching the final destination, Tokyo.\\nBack in those days, Manchuria was\\na puppet state of Japan, known as Manchukuo.\\nBut from 9th August,\\nthe Soviet Union started invading this place.\\nNetaji knew this,\\nso he thought that\\nhe should establish his first contact \\nwith the Soviets in Manchukuo.\\nFollowing this itinerary,\\nNetaji left Bangkok on the morning of 17th August\\nwith his INA group.\\nAnd reached Saigon, Vietnam around 10 AM.\\nUpon reaching here, he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people to sit \\nin the heavy bomber aircraft.\\nSo, it wasn\\'t possible for Netaji to go ahead \\nwith all his Indian National Army companions.\\nHe had to choose only one person.\\nHe chose to go on this journey with \\nhis companion Habibur Rahman.\\nOn 17th August around 5 PM,\\nthis plane took off from Saigon\\ncarrying about 12-13 people.\\nApart from Netaji and Colonel Habibur Rahman,\\nthe remaining passengers were either from \\nthe Japanese military or Japanese crew members.\\nBecause it was going to be dark soon,\\nthis plane made an unscheduled stop at Tourane,\\nwhich is the present-day Da Nang city.\\nThe passengers stayed the night at a hotel\\nand the crew worked on making this plane lighter.\\nMany weapons, ammunition, and machine guns\\nwere taken off the plane\\nso that it could be made lighter for the long journey.\\nNext morning on 18th August,\\nthe plane took off early at 5 AM.\\nAnd since the plane was lighter by then,\\nthe pilot skipped the next scheduled stop, Heito.\\nNext stop was Taihoku, the city of Taipei,\\nwhere the plane landed around 12 noon.\\nThe passengers had their lunch during the 2 hours stop\\nand the plane was refuelled.\\nDuring the plane\\'s testing,\\nthe pilot and the engineer saw that\\nthere was something wrong \\nwith the left engine of the plane.\\nThey didn\\'t investigate further,\\nthey thought it must be fine\\nsince the engine was fairly new.\\nOn 18th August, at 2 PM,\\nthe plane took off again.\\nJust a few minutes after the plane took off,\\na loud bang was heard.\\nAs if the plane\\'s engine had exploded.\\nThe plane started to go out of control\\nand it eventually crashed within a few seconds.\\nThe people in and near the cockpit,\\nthe pilot, co-pilot and a Japanese general,\\nd!ed immediately.\\nBehind the general, near the left wing,\\nnext to the plane\\'s petrol tank,\\nwas Netaji.\\nAnd behind him was Habibur Rahman.\\nSince both of them were towards the back of the plane,\\nmiraculously, after the crash,\\nthey came out of the plane alive.\\nBut Netaji was in a very bad condition, \\nbeing drenched in gasoline.\\nThe back door of the plane was not opening,\\nso they had to exit from the front entrance.\\nDoing this meant that\\nthey had to pass through the flames.\\nAnd since Netaji was completely drenched in petrol,\\nhe got burnt instantly.\\nHabibur Rahman tried his best to save him.\\nHe used clothes to put out the fire.\\nWithin 15 minutes, he takes Netaji \\nto the nearby Nammon Military Hospital.\\nBut unfortunately,\\nhe was unsuccessful in saving Netaji\\'s life.\\nThe d3ath of Subhash Chandra Bose\\ntook place in this hospital a few hours later.\\nThis painful story of the plane crash\\nis still merely a story for some people.\\nSome people believe that\\nNetaji had actually reached the Soviet Union\\nand he was imprisoned there\\nand tortured for the rest of his life.\\nOn the other hand, some people believe\\nthat this plane crash was just a ruse.\\nNetaji was actually alive\\nand he had returned to India in a disguise.\\nHe became a hermit in Ayodhya\\nand spent the rest of his life as a hermit.\\nGumnami Baba.\\nWhat\\'s the truth?\\nWhy is Netaji\\'s d3ath such a big mystery?\\nWhat was found when this was investigated?\\nLet\\'s try to understand these\\nin this video.\\nThis video is the second part\\non Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s story.\\nIf you haven\\'t seen the first video,\\nyou can find the link in the description below.\\nNow, before talking about which \\nconspiracy theory is true and which is not,\\nlet\\'s take a look at the pages of history.\\nOn an incident that is always ignored,\\nwhile talking about Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nI am talking about INA trials,\\nwhich took place on Delhi\\'s Red Fort \\non 5th November 1945.\\nThis is about 2.5 months after Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nMost of the Indian National Army troops\\nwere captured by the British.\\nApproximately 25,000 INA soldiers\\nwere in British custody.\\nOut of the 25,000, 3 soldiers\\nfaced a public case in Red Fort this day.\\n\"The British government decided that\\nin the eyes of the world,\\nto prove the Indian National Army a criminal group,\\nthere had to be an open trial in the Red Fort.\"\\nThese three soldiers were very special.\\nCaptain Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nLieutenant Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon,\\nand Captain Prem Kumar Sahgal.\\nDuring Netaji\\'s struggle over the last few years,\\nthe British Empire had cleverly\\nsuppressed all the news about the INA.\\nThis meant that most Indians did not know\\nthe extent of Netaji\\'s contributions.\\nBut when the INA troops were captured by the British,\\nthe British government decided to\\nportray these trials in a highly-publicised manner to the public.\\nThe news of the trials against these \\n3 soldiers\\' spread across the country.\\nThe British government believed that\\nsince Netaji\\'s INA had attacked the British government,\\npeople would see it as an attack against the country,\\npeople would treat the INA as traitors.\\nThey believed that the public support will be with the British\\nbecause the British government\\ntried to portray the British government as the country.\\nBut this plan backfired completely.\\nThe result was just the opposite.\\nMost people saw that\\nthe people who are labelled as traitors by the government\\nwere actually the biggest patriots.\\nThousands of people were out on the streets to protest.\\nThe common masses made their voices heard.\\nThey claimed that these soldiers should not be punished.\\nThe crowd of protesters soon reached the Red Fort.\\nInterestingly, these three officers\\nbelonged to three religions.\\nSahgal was a Hindu,\\nKhan was a Muslim,\\nand Dhillon was a Sikh.\\nIndia\\'s three major religious communities.\\nThe same religious harmony\\nthat was seen in Netaji Subhash \\nChandra Bose\\'s Indian National Army.\\nNow, it was there in front of the country in the Red Fort.\\nThese three soldiers became \\na symbol of religious and national unity.\\nA case was filed against these three\\nfor waging war against the nation\\nunder Section 121 of IPC.\\nAlong with charges of m*rder and abetment to m*rder.\\nBut seeing this attempt to label \\nthe freedom fighters as traitors,\\npeople were even more infuriated.\\nKolkata, the city where Netaji \\nhad spent many years of his life,\\nsaw the most violent protests.\\nOn 23rd November, in a police firing,\\naround 100 protesters were killed.\\nWhat was the Congress Party doing during this?\\nCongress established an INA defence committee.\\n\"On the advice of Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nthe Indian National Congress\\nhas established a high-level defence committee.\"\\nThey decided to legally defend \\nthese three soldiers in the court.\\nThe defence committee that was formed\\nincluded Tej Bahadur Sapru,\\nBhulabhai Desai,\\nAsaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru himself.\\nYou heard it right, Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nwho used to be a lawyer,\\nhad not worn the lawyer\\'s gown for many years.\\nBut at that point,\\nhe presented himself in the court as a lawyer.\\nThey argued in the British court that\\nthe provisional government created by Netaji\\nand the Indian National Army,\\nwas not illegal under international law.\\nBecause a state called Azad Hind \\n[Independent India] was created,\\nand its army had waged the war.\\nThey argued that the British \\ngovernment\\'s internal laws and regulations\\ncould not be imposed on Azad Hind and the INA.\\nObviously, since the British government \\nwas fighting in a British court,\\nthis legal fight was not successful.\\nOn 3rd January 1946,\\nwhen the court\\'s verdict was announced,\\nKhan, Sahgal, and Dhillon were \\nsentenced to transportation for life.\\nBasically, they are sent to exile\\nfrom where they would never return.\\nBut no court or government can withstand \\nthe power of the people.\\nThe people were so angry,\\nand the protests were relentless,\\nthat under public pressure, the government had to\\nrelease these soldiers.\\nThe British government was shocked to see\\nthat the soldiers of the British Indian Army\\nwere also revolting.\\nThose soldiers refused to fight,\\non behalf of the British.\\nThis later led to the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny.\\nThat is a story in itself,\\nwe can talk about that in another video.\\nBut because of these INA trials,\\nNetaji\\'s story had spread all over the country.\\nThe story of a man\\nwho had achieved such amazing feats in his life.\\nHow he could disguise himself repeatedly\\nto fool multiple countries.\\nHe went from one country to another to form an army.\\nSometimes in a submarine,\\nsometimes in an aeroplane.\\nThis story was no less than a superhero\\'s tale.\\nFor this reason, some people and \\nsome INA soldiers started doubting that\\nif Netaji had indeed d!ed in a plane crash.\\nThis didn\\'t seem probable.\\nHe had changed his disguises so many times,\\nfooled so many people,\\npeople started believing that \\nhe must be faking his d3ath too.\\nMaybe he used a body double in the plane crash.\\nBecause Allied Powers had already won World War II\\nand he did this to save himself from being captured.\\nOn top of that, there was no death certificate\\nnor any photo of the dead body.\\nThey had Habibur Rahman\\'s account only.\\nSo, it was understandable for people to have doubts.\\nEven when Mahatma Gandhi heard this news,\\nof Netaji\\'s plane having crashed,\\nhe too refused to believe that\\nNetaji could have died.\\nOnly after talking to Habibur Rahman personally,\\ndid Gandhi change his stance.\\nBut this doubt remained with many people in the country\\nand they kept waiting for the day\\nwhen Netaji would come back\\nand reveal himself to the public.\\nSome of them were Netaji\\'s associates.\\nAn organisation called Subhash Wadi Janta Party was formed\\nby some of these associates,\\nwho refuse to believe the plane crash theory.\\nAccording to their chronology, Netaji had come to India\\nand had become a hermit.\\nThey claim that he attended \\nGandhi ji\\'s cremation in 1948,\\nin disguise.\\nAnd then, from 1956 to 1959,\\nhe lived in a Shiva temple in Bareilly as a hermit.\\nThere, he is said to have become an expert in herbs\\nand even discovered the cure for tuberculosis.\\nIn 1959, Netahi is said to have\\nopened an ashram in Jalpaiguri city, Bengal.\\nShaulmari Ashram.\\nCalling himself Shreemad Saranandji.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nis called the Shaulmari Baba Theory.\\nThis ashram actually existed\\nand this Baba was also real.\\nIn the 1960s, this conspiracy theory spread so much that\\nShaulmari Baba had to clarify that\\nhe was not Netaji.\\nBut his followers still kept insisting,\\nthat he was Netaji \\neven though he claimed not to be.\\nAnother conspiracy theory that\\nwas developed by some other associates of Netaji\\nwas that the plane had actually landed\\nand he had reached the Soviet Union as planned.\\nBut in the Soviet, Netaji was captured by Russians\\nand then t0rtured in concentration camps.\\nThe Russians used this\\nas a leverage against Prime Minister Nehru.\\nIn fact, not only Nehru\\nbut even Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\\nwas threatened with this.\\nRussians said that if India did not side with the Soviet Union,\\nthey would release Netaji from jail\\nand let the whole world know.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nwas based on the misconception that\\nNetaji was a threat to Prime Minister Nehru\\nand opposed Congress.\\nAnd that if he were to return to India,\\nhe would have been the PM instead of Nehru.\\nThere is no rhyme nor reason \\nfor this conspiracy theory because\\nas I said in the previous video,\\nNetaji actually admired Nehru a lot.\\nThis is why he named on of the Azad Hind Brigade\\nafter Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nAnd the same mutual admiration\\nwas extended by Jawaharlal Nehru towards Netaji.\\nAfter his d3ath, he was called a national hero.\\nThere are some other interesting theories,\\nlike Netaji going to China,\\nand leading some operations there.\\nWe won\\'t talk about all that.\\nLet\\'s discuss the most popular theory about him.\\nThis is the theory of the Gumnami Baba.\\nHarvard professor Sugata Bose,\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nin his book His Majesty\\'s Opponent \\npublished in 2011,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose \\nand India\\'s Struggle Against Empire,\\nmentioned that in 2002,\\nthe judiciary asked him to donate 1 ml blood\\nso that his DNA could be compared to a Gumnami Baba\\'s.\\nThis was because some people were claiming\\nthat a Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThis was in 2002.\\n57 years since Netaji passed away.\\nHis family was shocked to know that\\neven government institutions were \\npromoting such a bizarre theory.\\nBut still, he donated his blood.\\nOf course, the evidence was negative.\\nThe DNA did not match.\\nBut still, the Gumnami Baba theory still remains popular.\\nThere are some people on social media\\nwho have taken up this theory again\\nand spread conspiracies repeatedly just for views.\\nThe theory of Gumnami Baba actually started in Russia.\\nThat under Stalin\\'s government\\nhe used to carry out top-secret covert operations.\\nLike a one-man army.\\nIn the Korean war of 1952,\\nhe is said to have led the Asian Liberation Army.\\nAfter that, in the war of 1962,\\nhe is said to have led the Chinese army against India\\nbecause he wanted to remove all western influence from India.\\nAnd since Indians didn\\'t recognise Gumnami Baba,\\nhe asked the army to retreat.\\nThe story doesn\\'t end here.\\nAfter this, in 1969, Gumnami Baba\\nfought against the USA in Vietnam.\\nIn 1971, he played a major role \\nin liberating Bangladesh.\\nHe was also guiding Mukti Vahini.\\nAnd finally, after everything,\\nhe became a hermit in India.\\nSpecifically, a hermit living in Ayodhya.\\nWho passed away on 16th September 1985.\\nThere was no photo of this Gumnami Baba\\'s d3ath,\\nnor was there any official d3ath certificate.\\nBut 44 days after his d3ath,\\na local newspaper published the news.\\nThe newspaper published that\\nthe Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThe newspaper was called Naye Log [New People].\\nSenior journalist Sheetla Singh,\\nwho was working with another local newspaper at that time,\\nnamed Jan Morcha,\\ninvestigated this story in November 1985.\\nFor his investigation,\\nhe went to Kolkata to meet a close friend of Netaji,\\nPabitra Mohan Roy,\\nformer Intelligence Officer of INA.\\nHe said that throughout the years\\nhe met a new hermit, or a new mysterious person\\nin his search of Netaji.\\nIn this attempt, he went from Kohima to Punjab,\\nfrom Faizabad to Ayodhya.\\nBut none of the Babas were Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nHere you might get confused\\nI talked about a few Babas earlier\\nso why was this person meeting different Babas every year.\\nActually, friends, this Baba angle\\nhas multiple versions.\\nMany claims by different people.\\nSomeone in Karnataka may claim that a certain Babas was Netaji,\\nsomeone may claim that in UP,\\nand someone in MP.\\nWhen this news was published in Jan Morcha\\nabout Gumnami Baba theory,\\na fight broke out in the media.\\nMany local newspapers in Uttar Pradesh,\\nstarted talking about\\nhow Gumnami Baba was like.\\nEveryone started claiming that he was Netaji.\\nSome people started saying that\\nthey had known for years \\nthat Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nBut because he had taken an oath\\nthat they could not tell anyone about this,\\nso they had to remain silent.\\nQuite ironic because actually\\nhad they actually taken an oath\\nthat they would not tell this to anyone\\nwhy would they talk about it now?\\nIf you think logically about this theory,\\nit doesn\\'t make any sense.\\nWhat would be Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s motivation\\nto hide his identity?\\nIf he really was Gumnami Baba,\\nthen why would he be in a disguise\\nand spend the rest of his life as a hermit?\\nSome people on social media claim that\\nthis was done to protect India\\'s geopolitical interests.\\nHad Netaji come in front of the public,\\nit wouldn\\'t have been good for India.\\nI don\\'t understand their strange logic.\\nI think some people spread such \\nconspiracy theories for attention and views.\\nAnother argument in favour of the Gumnami Baba Theory is that\\nthis Baba used to speak English fluently.\\nHe used to discuss geopolitical issues with great confidence.\\nThat\\'s why he could be none other than Netaji.\\nBut today, look around you.\\nThere are so many Babas\\nwho talk in English with great confidence.\\nHave discussions on geopolitical issues.\\nWould you ever say that they are not a Baba,\\nbut Albert Einstein in disguise?\\nI don\\'t want to counter these theories with jokes.\\nI want to show you the truth with proof.\\nBecause in the last 70 years,\\nmultiple investigations have been carried out on this.\\nA lot of inquiries have been conducted\\nand many reports have been published.\\nLet\\'s understand these reports one-by-one\\nand try to find out the truth.\\nThe first was the Figgess Report of 1946.\\nThis was an investigation by the British.\\nUnder Lord Mountbatten,\\nintelligence officer Colonel John Figgess\\nwas tasked with investigating the \\nd3ath of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nFiggess submitted his report on 25th July 1946.\\nThis report remained confidential for many decades.\\nBut today, it is publicly available.\\nThis report confirms four things.\\nFirst, a plane crashed on 18th August 1945\\nnear Taihoku airport.\\nSecond, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was in the plane.\\nThird, Netaji d!ed in a nearby \\nmilitary hospital on the same day.\\nFourth, he was cremated in Taihoku\\nand his ashes were later sent to Tokyo.\\nThe most important testimony in this report\\nwas of a Japanese doctor, \\nToyoshi Tsuruta,\\nwho was working in Nammon Hospital that day.\\nThe hospital where Netaji was taken after the crash.\\nIt is written in this report that\\nNetaji had asked the doctor in English\\nif he would stay with him the whole night.\\nBut at around 7 in the evening, he suffered a relapse\\nand the doctor gives him another camphor injection.\\nBut despite that, he passed away shortly after.\\nFriends, if you want to know \\nabout Indian history and world history in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks on Kuku FM.\\nLike this one on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nOr this one on Stalin.\\nThere are many audiobooks on Indian freedom fighters too.\\nLike this one on Mahatma Gandhi.\\nKuku FM is a great platform for audio learning.\\nBecause you get to listen to numerous audiobooks here.\\nOn almost every topic.\\nWhether you want to study history, \\ngeography, politics, religion or fiction.\\nEverything will be in audio form.\\nIf you haven\\'t joined Kuku FM yet,\\nyou can find a special 50% off \\ncoupon code in the description.\\nYou can check it out.\\nNow let\\'s get back to the topic.\\nFor this mystery, the second major inquiry\\nwas conducted in 1956.\\nThis was the first inquiry by the Indian government.\\nThe Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThis committee was led by Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nthe same INA officer who was put on trial in Red Fort.\\nBut there were two other notable members on this committee,\\nS N Maitra, a civil servant of the West Bengal government,\\nand Suresh Chandra Bose, Netaji\\'s elder brother.\\nBetween April and July 1956,\\nthis committee interviewed 67 witnesses.\\nIn India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam,\\npeople who met Netaji before the crash.\\nAnd those who survived the crash.\\nThere were 7 survivors of this plane crash.\\nAnd this committee interviewed 5 of them in person\\nAlong with that, an additional doctor,\\nDr. Yoshimi, who was a surgeon in that hospital\\nwho treated Netaji in his final hours,\\nwas also interviewed.\\nThis inquiry resulted in a 3-page draft report.\\nWhich had three major points.\\nFirst, on 18th August, a plane \\ncrashed in Taihoku where Netaji d!ed.\\nSecond, he was cremated there.\\nAnd third, his ashes\\nwere taken to the Renkoji temple in Tokyo\\nand placed there.\\nBut the strange thing here was that\\none of the three people on this committee,\\nNetaji\\'s elder brother, Suresh Chandra Bose,\\nrefused to sign the final report.\\nHe wrote a note in which he blamed Shahnawaz and Nehru\\nfor withholding crucial evidence.\\nAccording to him, the committee\\'s aim was to prove\\nthat Netaji d!ed in this plane crash.\\nAnd the final report of 181 pages,\\nif two or more stories narrated by witnesses\\ndid not match other testimonies,\\nthen the entire testimony of the witness\\nshould be considered false.\\nBased on this, Suresh Chandra Bose said\\nthat there was no crash,\\nand that his brother was still alive\\nclaiming that the committee report was incorrect.\\nThe final report was still published with two-thirds consensus\\non 3rd August 1956\\nand the Indian Parliament accepted it in September 1956.\\nBut Suresh Chandra Bose did not give any alternate theory.\\nIn February 1966,\\n10 years after the publication of the report,\\nhe claimed that in the following month, March,\\nNetaji would reveal himself to the world.\\nOnce again, this claim spread among the masses.\\nCould Netaji really be alive?\\nMarch came and went but Netaji never returned.\\nMid-1960s was the time when\\nthe stories of Shaulmari Baba were becoming popular.\\nBecause of this, the government decided\\nthat another inquiry should be conducted.\\nIn 1970, a Khosla commission was set up\\nas the third major inquiry into the d3ath of Netaji.\\nThe Khosla Commission was a one-man commission,\\nonly one person was carrying out the investigation.\\nG.D. Khosla,\\nwho was the retired Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court.\\nHe submitted his report in 1974.\\nAnd his report reiterated the same things\\nstated by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThere was one major difference between the investigation he conducted\\nand that conducted by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nJustice Khosla actually went to Taiwan\\nto see the crash site.\\nBut he couldn\\'t find the crash site.\\nBecause the airport where the crash happened\\ndidn\\'t exist after 1970.\\nShah Nawaz Committee members had tried to go to Taiwan\\nbut at that time, India-Taiwan relations weren\\'t good.\\nSo it was not possible.\\nBut the Khosla Commission didn\\'t discover anything new.\\nJustice Khosla spoke to more than 224 witnesses.\\nFour co-passengers of Netaji who had survived this crash\\nand five eyewitnesses who had seen this crash,\\nwere interviewed.\\nBy this time, many conspiracy theories had already gained traction,\\nand Justice Khosla had written in his report \\n\"to what extent fantasy and perversion of truth can proceed.\"\\nThe stories and conspiracy theories that were being spread,\\nhad political goals.\\nOr were spread by people who simply wanted to seek attention.\\nHe was surprised to see the extent to which\\nfake news can be spread about this.\\nOur story would have ended here,\\nbut as I said, in the late 1980s,\\nstories of the Gumnami Baba started becoming popular.\\nSo in 1999, when the BJP government was formed,\\nthe government decided that\\nthere should be another investigation.\\nThe government appointed a retired Supreme Court judge,\\nManoj Kumar Mukherjee,\\nto investigate this case.\\nAnd this is how the Mukherjee Commission was formed.\\nMore than 100 files were investigated by this commission.\\nThey went to Japan, Russia, and Taiwan again.\\nDNA test was carried out to test the Gumnami Baba theory.\\nThe DNA test I mentioned earlier in this video.\\nBut this DNA test proved to be a failure.\\nBut the real purpose of this report\\nwas to prove somehow that\\nthe theory of the plane crash was wrong.\\nAnd to prove this theory wrong,\\nmany claims were raised in the Mukherjee report.\\nFirst, it is stated that Habibur Rahman said\\nthat this plane took a nose dive from 12,000 feet and crashed.\\nThis report question that\\nin such a case, no one would be able to survive.\\nSo this theory had to be false.\\nBut where did this 12,000 feet figure come from?\\nNo one knows.\\nBecause Habibur Rehman never said that.\\nAnd by the time this Mukherjee Commission was formed,\\nHabibur Rehman had already passed away due to natural causes.\\nThe Mukherjee Commission concluded that\\nthis flight did take off from Saigon\\nbut it didn\\'t crash.\\nHe said that Netaji would still be alive\\nbecause there were no records or documents in any hospital or crematorium\\nrelated to his d3ath.\\nIt is worth noting that\\nby this point in time, 55 years had already passed\\nsince the plane crash.\\nEven after all this,\\nthe Mukherjee Commission did not present any alternate theory.\\nIt did not state\\nwhat could have happened \\nother than the plane crash.\\nThird, this report stated that\\nthe Japanese temple where Netaji\\'s ashes \\nwere said to have been placed,\\nwas not actually Netaji\\'s ashes\\nbut the ashes of a Japanese soldier.\\nBut when the chief priest of that temple said\\nthat they could do a DNA test,\\nJustice Mukherjee did not get the test done.\\nAnother false claim raised in Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was that\\nwhy was nothing published in any newspaper about Netaji\\'s d3ath\\nwhen the plane crashed.\\nThis was the argument in this report.\\nBut, actually, there were two local Taiwanese newspapers\\nthat published this news.\\nTaiwan Didi Shimpao and \\nTaiwan Nichi Nichi Shimbun.\\nIn both these newspapers, not only was the plane crash reported\\nbut they also mentioned Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nOn top of that, historian Leonard A. Gordon,\\nwho was the biographer for Bose,\\nsaid that his books were mentioned as resources in this report\\nbut they were misinterpreted. \\nThe names of the books were mistitled or mislisted.\\nFinally, the Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was published 6 years later,\\non 8th November 2005.\\nAnd in May 2006,\\nwhen this report was submitted to the Indian Parliament,\\nthe Parliament rejected this report.\\nThe reason for the rejection was obvious,\\nthe things I just told you about,\\nbut by this time, Congress\\' UPA government had come into power.\\nThe rumours of conspiracy\\nwere going to continue.\\nBecause people were saying,\\nthose who were propagating this conspiracy theory,\\nthat since the Congress government was back in power,\\nthis report was going to be rejected anyway.\\nBut even if you believe the Mukherjee Commission Report,\\nand claim that the theory of the plane crash is wrong,\\nthe second problem is that\\nthere was no alternate explanation.\\nIf the plane crash didn\\'t happen, \\nwhat did happen?\\nThe Mukherjee Commission said nothing regarding it.\\nPeople\\'s next hope were the classified files.\\nThere are many old files\\nwhich have been classified by the Indian government\\nand not presented to the public.\\nSo, there must be some truth hidden in these files.\\nBy 2016, the Modi government had come into power,\\n304 files were declassified by the government.\\nThis was announced in the Parliament\\non 2nd March 2016.\\nThese were the last files which \\nwere not presented to the public.\\nMany files were declassified by previous governments as well.\\nFor example, the first HD Deve Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified 990 files in 1997.\\nAfter that, Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\ndeclassified around 1,000 files in 2012.\\nWhy were these files declassified at three different times?\\nThe reason was that Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified mostly Ministry of Defense\\'s files.\\nDr Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\nmostly declassified the files of the Home and Defense Ministry.\\nIn 2016, Modi\\'s government\\ndeclassified the files from the PMO, \\nMinistry of External Affairs and Cabinet Secretary.\\nIn the last declassification of the files,\\none file was regarding the Indian Independence League.\\nThe Indian Independence League had \\nconducted an independent investigation\\ninto the d3ath of Netaji.\\nIn 1953, a report was submitted on this.\\nA shocking thing was revealed in this report.\\nThis report states that\\nthe plane crash theory was true.\\nBut it is also states that\\nthis plane crash was carried out\\nby a faction of the Japanese government.\\nIn the beginning of the video, I told you\\nhow Netaji went from Bangkok to Saigon,\\nwith 6 INA associates.\\nBut in Saigon he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people on the plane.\\nAccording to this report, this was a calculated plan.\\nSome people in the Japanese government\\nwanted to have this plane be crashed.\\nThe year when the Modi government declassified these files,\\nthe government asked other countries\\nto declassify their files too,\\nthat related to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nSo in response, Austria, Germany, \\nRussia, the UK, and the USA,\\nplaced all their files related to Netaji in public domain.\\nThey declassified their files.\\nBut, and this is an important but,\\nJapan was the only country that \\ndidn\\'t declassify all their secret files.\\nJapan had 5 secret files.\\nThey did declassify 2 of them\\nthat mention the same things.\\nA plane crash and the same descriptions.\\nBut to date, Japan still has 3 such classified files.\\nJapan has not released them to the public.\\nDoes this mean that\\nthis plane crash was really \\norchestrated by some Japanese people?\\nWithout any further evidence,\\nI don\\'t want to draw any conclusions here.\\nWe can know this for certain\\nonly when we get more evidence supporting it.\\nBut I will say that things look suspicious\\nbecause these 3 files have not been declassified.\\nBut whether this is true or not,\\none thing is for certain.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s d3ath\\nhappened that day, in that plane crash.\\nWe can say this for sure.\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nChandra Kumar Bose, who was \\na BJP member till September 2023,\\nsaid that his family regrets that\\nthey believed in these conspiracy theories for years.\\nThis is a bitter truth that they had to accept.\\nThe truth that Netaji\\nd!ed in that air crash.\\nHe also said that the rumours and \\nconspiracy theories that are spread\\nare an insult to Netaji.\\nWe should reject all these conspiracy theories\\nand ignore the people who spread such rumours.\\nWe cannot say with 100% accuracy\\nwhy the plane crash happened.\\nBut we do know that between 1945 and 1974,\\n10 different investigations took place to uncover the truth.\\nBy the British Army, \\nby the Japan Allied Command,\\nby the British India Government, \\nby the Japanese Government,\\nby the Taiwanese Government,\\nby the Independent India\\'s Government.\\nIn addition to these, many individual journalists\\ncarried out independent investigations.\\nAll investigations reached the same conclusion.\\nThe same points that were mentioned \\nin the Shah Nawaz Commission Report.\\nNetaji\\'s only daughter, Anita Bose, believes this too.\\n\"And I think the declassification of files\\ncertainly also made available \\nthe documentation which prove that\\nhe d!ed, in fact, on August 18th, 1945\\nin an air crash,\\nor as a consequence of an air crash,\\nin what is now Taiwan.\"\\nIf Netaji\\'s family does not believe in these conspiracy theories\\nand considers them disrespectful,\\nthen the least we can do is\\nto stop spreading these rumours.\\nIf we want to honour Netaji\\'s legacy,\\nwe should learn from his values.\\nWe should take inspiration from his story,\\ninstead of spreading these conspiracies.\\nIf you found this video informative,\\nyou can click here to watch part 1 of this video,\\nwhere I tell you about Netaji\\'s story.\\nAnd I\\'ll see you in the next video.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None,

\\nfrom the city of Kiel, Germany.\\nAlthough it carried the Nazi soldiers in it,\\nan Indian was also present among them.\\nAn Indian whose name was Matsuda.\\nThis submarine was tasked with \\nthe mission to travel Southward,\\nto go around Africa\\nand transfer Mr. Matsuda to a Japanese submarine.\\nIt sounds easy,\\nbut it was not without danger\\nThe sea route was full of British ships.\\nAnd this was during the World War II\\nwhen Germany and Japan \\nwere fighting against the British.\\nOn 26th April 1943,\\nafter a journey of about two and a half months,\\nwhen this German submarine \\nreached the coast of Madagascar,\\na Japanese submarine was spotted in front of it.\\nBut the sea was so stormy that\\nit could have been dangerous for \\nthese two submarines to get closer.\\nSo for the next two days, these submarines\\nkept moving in parallel.\\nFinally, when the weather cleared,\\nMr. Matsuda emerged from the submarine.\\nOn a small raft, paddling and drenched,\\nhe reached the Japanese submarine,\\nwhere he was welcomed by Captain Masao Teraoka.\\nYou may be wondering\\nwhy these German and Japanese submarines\\nwere helping an Indian during World War II.\\nThis is because, Mr. Matsuda is none other than\\nour Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nUnknowingly perhaps, \\nduring this historic journey,\\nhe became the first Indian\\nto travel in a submarine.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose is one \\nof the greatest freedom fighters of India\\nand his story is full of such amazing stories.\\nHow he escaped under the nose of the British government\\nwent to Germany, met Hitler,\\nwent to Russia and Japan,\\nmet the Japanese Prime Minister,\\nwent to Singapore, formed his own army.\\nAnd even while staying outside India,\\nhe launched the biggest war on \\nthe British government occupying India. \\nLet\\'s understand his story in this video.\\nLet\\'s start our story with 1939,\\nthe year when World War II started.\\nViceroy Lord Linlithgow\\ndeclared war on behalf of India\\nwithout consulting any Indian.\\nThis was an embarrassing situation for Congress.\\nAnd under the Government of India Act,\\nCongress had some control over the ministries\\nand so they resigned from their positions.\\nMeanwhile, Subhash Chandra Bose \\nwas organizing his own party,\\nThe Forward Bloc.\\nAlthough this party was formed from within the Congress,\\nbut by the year 1940,\\nit was separated from the Congress\\'s main organization.\\nThere were two reasons behind this.\\nFirst, Subhash Chandra Bose was \\nbecoming too vocal about his leftist ideology,\\nwhich wasn\\'t appreciated by the other leaders of Congress.\\nI have talked about this in detail \\nin the video on Gandhi versus Bose.\\nThe link is in the description \\nin case you haven\\'t watched it yet.\\nAnd the second reason was that Bose wanted\\nto use World War II for India\\'s benefit.\\nHe wanted to take action quickly\\nand breaking off from Congress \\nhad become a necessity for him.\\nIn July 1940,\\nBose was leading a march in Calcutta\\nbecause of which he was arrested by the British government.\\nBeing in jail, he challenged the government\\nby launching a hunger strike.\\n\"Release me, or I shall refuse to live.\"\\nHe made a straightforward announcement.\\n\"In 1940, he was languishing in prison.\\nSo he gave an ultimatum to the British government\\nand undertook a fast unto d3ath.\"\\nGradually, his health deteriorated.\\nAnd in just one week, the government decided\\nto release him from jail\\nand put him under house arrest.\\nThe government did not want to be blamed\\nif Subhash Chandra Bose were to d!e in jail.\\nSo they thought that as long as he was in poor health,\\nhe should be under house arrest.\\nAnd as soon as his health improved,\\nthey wanted to throw him back in jail.\\nBut Netaji was devising his own plans.\\nHis plan was to go to Germany\\nand ask the Germans for help\\nto fight against the British.\\nBut how could he reach Germany?\\nBose contacted a communist organization in Punjab\\nto find out if there was a way\\nto cross the border and reach Germany secretly.\\nHe was told that there was a way.\\nTo enter through Afghanistan,\\nand go to the Soviet Union,\\nfrom there he could go to Germany.\\nOn 16th January 1941,\\nat around 1.30 AM,\\nwhen the city was sleeping,\\nNetaji sneaked out of his house\\nwith his nephew, Shishir Kumar Bose.\\nHe was in disguise.\\nHe was pretending to be an insurance agent,\\nMuhammad Ziauddin.\\nTogether with Shishir, they drove through the dark all night\\nand reached Dhanbad at around 8.30 AM.\\nThey spend a night at Shishir\\'s brother Ashok\\'s house\\nand the next day, from the nearby Gomo station,\\nBose boarded the train Kalka Mail.\\nThis train reached Delhi first\\nand there, he took another train to go to Peshawar,\\nthe Frontier Mail.\\nIn Peshawar, he was received by\\nthe provincial leader of the Forward Bloc, \\nMian Akbar Shah.\\nThe next step was to leave the territory occupied by the British.\\nTo do this, he changed his disguise.\\nInstead of Mohammad Ziauddin,\\nhe became a deaf and mute Pathan man.\\nIt was necessary to be deaf and mute because\\nBose could not speak Pashto.\\nSo, if anyone came to check them at the border,\\nthe person accompanying him could tell them\\nthat he was a deaf and mute Pathan.\\nHe travelled with another leader of \\nthe Forward Bloc, Bhagat Ram Talwar,\\nand both pretended that they were going to \\nthe shrine of Adda Sharif in Afghanistan.\\nTo pray that they could speak and hear.\\nOn 26th January 1941,\\nthey left Peshawar\\nand crossed the border of the British Empire by evening.\\nBy the morning of 29th January,\\nthey had reached Adda Sharif\\nand completed the journey to Kabul in trucks and tanks.\\nIt took Netaji 15 days to reach Kabul from Calcutta.\\nBut the British government found out about his escape\\n12 days after the fact.\\nThis is because the people at his home,\\nconstantly delivered food to his room.\\nAnd his other nephews would simply eat his food.\\nPeople believed that Netaji was still in his room.\\nSince the food was delivered and eaten regularly.\\nHis escape was so secret that\\neven his mother didn\\'t know about it.\\nIt was only on 27th January\\nwhen a case was to be heard against \\nSubhash Chandra Bose in the court.\\nAnd when he did not appear at the court,\\nhis two nephews informed the police\\nthat he was not at home.\\nOn 27th January, the news of his \\ndisappearance was published in the newspaper,\\nin Anand Bazaar Patrika and Hindustan Herald.\\nAfter which Reuters picked up on it\\nand this news spread all over the world.\\nMany reports were made to the British intelligence.\\nOne report said that he was on a ship going to Japan,\\nanother said something else\\nbut none of the reports were correct.\\nA ship going to Japan from Calcutta \\nwas searched by the British.\\nBut there was no sign of Bose.\\nSubhash had told his nephew Shishir that\\nif the news of his escape could be a secret for 4-5 days,\\nit would be impossible to catch him after that.\\nAnd this was true because\\nafter that, the British government could not catch him again.\\nAfter reaching Kabul, Netaji went \\nto the Soviet embassy to ask for help.\\nBut he didn\\'t get any help from there\\nbecause the Russians mistook him to be a British agent\\nwho wanted to infiltrate the Soviet Union.\\nThen he tried to contact the German embassy.\\nHans Pilger, a German minister who was \\npresent at the embassy at that time,\\nsent a telegram to the German foreign minister\\non 5th February,\\nsaying that after meeting Subhash,\\nhe had advised him to\\nstay hidden in the market with his Indian friends\\nand on his behalf,\\nthe German minister would contact the Russian ambassador.\\nA few days later, Netaji received a message that\\nif he wanted to leave Afghanistan,\\nhe should meet the Italian ambassador.\\nThis meeting took place on 22nd February, 1941,\\nAnd on 10th March, Bose was asked to\\nget a new Italian passport.\\nBose was given a new Italian passport\\nwith a new Italian identity.\\nThis was the photo on his Italian passport\\nand his new name was Orlando Mazzotta.\\nIn the meantime, the British government had \\nintercepted an Italian diplomatic communication\\nand they had found out that\\nBose was in Kabul.\\nThey also found out that he was planning \\nto go to Germany through the Middle East.\\nTwo special operations executives of \\nBritish intelligence were tasked with\\nfinding Bose in Turkey and k!lling him before he reached Germany.\\nBut Netaji was one step ahead.\\nHe never went to the Middle East.\\nInstead, he went to Moscow using his new identity. \\nFrom Moscow, he finally boarded a train to Berlin,\\nand on 2nd April 1941,\\nhe reached the German capital, Berlin.\\nHere, Netaji had 3 objectives.\\nFirst, to set up an Indian government in exile.\\nSecond, to find a way for his voice to reach the people.\\nAnd third, to establish an army\\nmade up of Indians,\\nthose Indians who were prisoners of war.\\nNow let\\'s see one-by-one how Netaji worked on these\\nand how he met the German dictator, Hitler.\\nThe biggest struggle was that Germany\\nhad to give a diplomatic recognition to India.\\nHe wanted Germany and the other Axis Powers\\nto officially declare India to be a free country.\\nAnd to make India\\'s independence on of their war aims.\\nBut Germany never gave such a declaration\\nbecause Hitler was not comfortable with this idea.\\nIn his infamous book Mein Kampf, \\nHitler stated his opinion about India.\\nHe wrote that he admired the British government\\nfor the way they have dominated and administered India.\\nAnd despite having German blood,\\nin spite of everything,\\nhe wrote that he wanted to see India under British rule.\\nNot only that, Hitler made fun of Indian freedom fighters\\nby calling them Asiatic jugglers.\\nIndia\\'s fight for freedom was a joke to Hitler.\\nBut still, Hitler wanted to use Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\nagainst the British in WWII.\\nNetaji was fully aware that\\nhis relationship with the Nazi Germany\\nwas merely a transactional relationship.\\nBoth sides saw their benefit,\\nthat\\'s why the relationship existed.\\nOtherwise, it wouldn\\'t.\\nWith this, he started working.\\nHe made plans on how\\nIndia can collaborate with the Axis Powers.\\nHe established a Free India Center in Berlin.\\nAnd then he submitted a memorandum to Hitler,\\nasking Hitler to attack India with his army,\\nso that the British could be removed from there.\\nIt would be akin to attacking the heart of the British Empire.\\nHe tried to manipulate the situation\\nto incite Hitler into taking his army\\nand fighting the British in India.\\nBut that had no positive result.\\nThe main reason was that Hitler \\nwas not concerned about India\\'s freedom.\\nBut there was another German who was \\nactually quite interested in helping Bose.\\nAdam von Trot,\\nhead of the India section of the Foreign Office in Berlin.\\nWith his help, this Foreign Office\\nwas turned into a Special India Division.\\nA few months later, on 2nd November 1941,\\nBose established the Free India Centre there.\\nIn fact, on this very road, \\nthat building you see there,\\nused to be the office of the Free India Centre.\\nToday, that\\'s just a cafe.\\nThere is no sign of it being an office before.\\nOn the other side, there is the Spanish embassy.\\nIn the first meeting at this centre, \\n6 decisions were made.\\nFirst, the name of the struggle \\nwas to be Azad Hind or Free India.\\nSecond, in Europe, the name of this organisation would be\\nAzad Hind Centre.\\nThird, the national anthem of our country would be Jana Gana Mana.\\nFourth, the emblem of the movement\\nwould be in tricolour with a springing tiger.\\nFifth, Indians would greet each other \\nwith the slogan of Jai Hind.\\nAnd the sixth, Subhash Chandra Bose would be given the title\\nNetaji.\\nOn 20th May 1941,\\nNetaji submitted a detailed plan to the German government\\non how to work on propaganda against \\nBritish imperialism all over the world.\\nA part of this plan was Azad Hind Radio.\\nOn 19th February 1942,\\nNetaji decided to give up the identity of Orlando Mazotta.\\nHe dropped it\\nand revealed his real identity to the world.\\nHe broadcast his first message \\nto the world through Azad Hind Radio.\\nThis is Subhash Chandra Bose\\nspeaking to you over Azad Hind Radio.\\nAnd starting in February 1942,\\nit began to be broadcast to the Indian population too.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose\\'s first address \\nto his countrymen through this radio was\\nthat everyone would continue with the struggle.\\nAnd that the Axis powers would soon help them in their mission\\nand together, they would fight against British imperialism.\\n\"Brothers and sisters,\\nthe struggle for freedom that we have started,\\nwe need to continue it until\\nwe get complete independence.\"\\nApart from the radio, a monthly journal was started,\\ncalled Azad Hind,\\nwith copies being rolled out starting in March 1942.\\nWithin a few days,\\n5,000 copies were circulated in Germany.\\nBut there were problems working on the third motive.\\nThe army that Bose wanted to create\\nhe wanted it to be called the Indian National Army.\\nBut the Nazi government refused to \\nrecognise a new independent army.\\nThat\\'s why this military unit was named\\nIndian Legion.\\nBose met more than 10,000 \\nprisoners of war and talked to them.\\nHe couldn\\'t convince everyone.\\nBut about half of the people were convinced to join his army.\\nSo, the strength of the Indian Legion \\nwas about 5,000 people.\\nEven though this army was small \\nin many ways, it was historic.\\nBecause Netaji had successfully brought people \\ntogether despite their castes and religious beliefs.\\nCaptain Walter Harbich,\\nthe one in charge of the training camp at that time,\\nnoted that\\n\"His Excellency, Netaji\\'s goal was to\\nparalyse the century-old antagonisms\\nrooted in the Indian nationalities,\\nreligions and castes,\\nand to unite the members of both these units\\nin one great common aim.\\n26th August, 1942.\\nIndian Legion took its oath and with that,\\nNetaji was almost successful in \\nfulfilling his goals in Germany.\\nExcept for one thing,\\nThe Axis powers were still\\nnot declaring India as independent yet.\\nThe reason was Hitler\\'s negative attitude towards Indians.\\nA few months ago, in May 1942,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose managed to meet Adolf Hitler.\\nAfter this meeting,\\nNetaji was convinced that Hitler was \\nmore interested in propaganda victories\\nas compared to actually winning with military strength.\\nThat\\'s why Netaji turned his attention towards Japan.\\nTill then, news had already reached Japan\\nthat an army of Indians was being formed in Germany\\nto oust the British from of India.\\nJapanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo had taken note of it.\\nSince early 1942, he had been saying that\\nit was time for Indians to stand up against British rule.\\nIf you want to know about the World War II stories in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks for that on KUKU FM.\\nLike this one on Joseph Stalin,\\nthe leader of the Soviet Union during World War II.\\nOr this one on Alan Turing,\\na genius who cracked the German code\\nand helped the British in this world

side in Singapore,\\nafter Japan\\'s takeover, became Japan\\'s prisoners of war.\\nHere, Netaji saw another opportunity.\\nWhy not include those people in his army too?\\nIn the midst of all this, in August 1942,\\nMahatma Gandhi announced the Quit India Movement.\\nIn India, hundreds of thousands of people\\nwere ready for the revolution against the British government.\\nWhen this news reached Netaji,\\nhe was happy to hear it.\\nThrough Azad Hind Radio, he sent his message\\nthat all Indians should support Gandhi ji.\\nHe called the movement India\\'s non-violent guerilla warfare.\\nEven though a few years ago, there were \\ndisagreements in Gandhi ji and Netaji\\'s views.\\nTheir opinions often clashed.\\nBut at this point in time,\\nthey supported each other.\\nOn 31st August 1942,\\nwhen Netaji found out that people like \\nSavarkar and Jinnah\\nwere against the Quit India Movement,\\nthis is what he had to say on Azad Hind Radio.\\n\"I would request Mr Jinnah and Mr Savarkar\\nand all those leaders who still \\nthink of a compromise with the Britishers,\\nTo realize for once and all\\nthat in the world of tomorrow \\nthere would be no British Empire.\\nHe addressed leaders like Jinnah and Savarkar\\nand told them that there was no future for the British Empire.\\nThe last time Gandhi ji and Netaji met in person was in 1940.\\nIn that meeting, Gandhi ji told Netaji,\\nthat if Netaji\\'s could successfully free India, \\nthe first telegram congratulating \\nhim would be from Gandhi ji.\\nThis incident was written by Netaji \\nin his book, The Indian Struggle.\\nThough, their ideologies and ways were different,\\nthey greatly admired each other.\\nGandhi ji was fighting in India\\nand Netaji was fighting from outside India.\\n8th February 1943,\\nNetaji appointed his friend ACN Nambiar in charge \\nof the Indian Legion and Azad Hind Centre.\\nAnd he left Germany to head towards Japan.\\nThis time, he didn\\'t take a land route.\\nInstead, he dove into the water,\\nin a German submarine.\\nU-180 German Submarine.\\nOnce again, he changed his disguise\\nand become Mr. Matsuda.\\nI had talked about this story at the beginning of the video.\\nBy the way, he was not the only Indian to sit in the submarine.\\nHe was accompanied by another leader of the Indian Legion,\\nAbid Hasan Safrani.\\nTwo and a half months later, on the coast of Madagascar,\\nboth of them changed the submarine\\nand were welcomed in the Japanese submarine.\\nOn May 8th, 1943,\\nthis submarine reached Sabang,\\nwhich is part of present-day Indonesia.\\nFrom there, they took a flight to Tokyo\\nand on May 16th, they reached Japan.\\nNetaji met with the Japanese Prime Minister, Tojo twice.\\nThe first time was on 10th June and the second on 14th June.\\nIn their second meeting, Netaji openly asked him,\\nif Japan would help the Indian independence movement unconditionally?\\nHe wanted to confirm that\\nJapan would help India with no strings attached.\\nIn Germany, Hitler did not agree to this \\neven after months of effort,\\nbut this one question was enough in Japan.\\nTojo immediately agreed to help Netaji.\\nJapan\\'s support was public for the entire world to see.\\nTwo days later, on 16th June, Bose attended the \\n82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet.\\nAnd there, Prime Minister Tojo gave a historic address.\\n\"India has been for centuries under England\\'s rule.\"\\nHe joined India\\'s aspiration for complete independence.\\nHe claimed that Japan would do everything possible\\nto help Indian independence.\\n\"I am convinced the day of Indian freedom \\nand prosperity is not far off.\"\\nAfter this, Subhash Chandra Bose gave a statement\\nwhich was recorded on video.\\nWe have very few real video footage of Netaji.\\nThis is one of them.\\nHave a look.\\nThere was another freedom fighter in Japan \\nwho invited Subhash Chandra Bose\\nRash Behari Bose.\\nHere, I would like to tell you an interesting fact\\nthat he was actually the leader of the \\nIndian National Army at this point in time.\\nYou might be thinking, how could this be possible?\\nThe INA was made by Netaji,\\nbut no.\\nThe INA actually existed even before Netaji went to Japan.\\nThe first Indian National Army was actually formed by\\nGeneral Mohan Singh in February 1942,\\nwhen Singapore fell into the hands of Japan.\\nThis INA operated till December 1942,\\nafter which Mohan Singh disbanded this army\\nbecause of disputes with the Japanese.\\nThe reason was that the Japanese wanted\\nthe Indian National Army to fight on their behalf in Southeast Asia.\\nJust like the British made them their pawns.\\nMany Indians refused to do this\\nand so those units were shut down\\nand Mohan Singh was taken into custody by the Japanese.\\nThis is where Rash Behari Bose entered the narrative.\\nHe acted as a leader and stoped \\nthe INA from completely disbanding.\\nWith Rash Behari Bose, Subhash Chandra \\nBose reached Singapore on 2nd July\\nand were warmly welcomed with garlands.\\nRam Singh Thakuri played a song when they came out of the plane.\\nYou can watch another original video here.\\n\"The one India is proud of,\\nthe pride of India is here.\\nSubhash is the life of India.\\nSubhash is the pride of India.\\nSubhash ji, Subhash ji,\\nhe is the life of India.\"\\nAnd here, the command of the \\nremaining INA was given to Netaji.\\nThis was a very historic moment because\\nmany Indians had gathered in Singapore\\'s Padang\\nto listen to Netaji.\\nHere, he gave an inspiring speech.\\nA speech where he used the slogan \\'Chalo Dilli\\'. \\n[Let\\'s March To Delhi]\\n[Victory to Subhash Chandra Bose]\\nThere were around 13,000 soldiers in \\nthe Indian National Army in Singapore.\\nNetaji\\'s plan was to first expand the army.\\nHe wanted to gather 50,000 soldiers first.\\nAnd later, to form a strong army of \\n3 million people.\\nThe Japanese government was shocked to hear this plan.\\nThey said that they could not \\nprovide weapons to so many people.\\nThey could provide weapons to about 30,000 people only.\\nBut for Netaji, this was not \\na fight to be fought with weapons only.\\nHe wanted that eventually,\\nthe average citizens of the nation should be a part of his army.\\nAnd then, together, the Indians would overthrow the British.\\nThere were similarities between this faction \\nand the Indian Legion in Germany.\\nThe soldiers in INA were from various religious backgrounds,\\nbut there was no discrimination among them.\\nThe motto of the Indian National Army \\nwas made up of three Urdu words:\\nIttefaq, Itmaad, and Qurbani\\nwhich means Unity, Faith, and Sacrifice.\\nIn total, the INA was divided into five regiments\\nand these five regiments were named\\nafter five freedom fighters.\\nGandhi, Nehru,\\nMaulana Azad, Subhash,\\nand Rani of Jhansi.\\nEven the campaign poster of the INA\\nwhich had the phrase, Chalo Dilli,\\nhad a photo of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nOn another poster, there were quotes from both \\nSubhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi.\\nBut today, there are people who\\nspread fake news on WhatsApp to show that\\nthese two opposed each other.\\nOn 7th August 1943,\\nNetaji clearly said in a radio address,\\neven though Gandhi supported non-violence,\\nhe was ready to give his full support to the Indian National Army.\\nAnd more significant than this was the fact that\\nGandhi\\'s followers would also support them.\\nOn 2nd October 1943,\\nNetaji gave another message to Gandhi ji through the radio.\\nHe said that Mahatma Gandhi\\'s services to India\\nwere unique and unparalleled,\\nthat his name should be written in \\ngold in our national history, forever.\\nNo single person could achieve as much in their life\\nunder those circumstances,\\nas much as Gandhi had achieved.\\nGandhiji reciprocated Netaji\\'s admiration\\nby giving him the title of Prince of the Patriots.\\nOn 21st August 1943,\\nNetaji set up the Provisionary Government \\nof Azad Hind in Singapore.\\nHe became the head of this provincial government.\\nHe said that it was not a normal government,\\nthat their mission was unique.\\nThey were a fighting organization\\nand they planned to declare war against the British government.\\n\"The skies reverberated with full throated shouts of\\nJai Hind!\"\\nBy then, Netaji did not have any territory,\\nbut the Indian diaspora living in South East Asia,\\nwas officially under his jurisdiction.\\nThe government established in Singapore \\nhad the right to collect taxes,\\nenforce laws and even\\nrecruit soldiers for their army.\\nTwo months later, in December 1943,\\nthe Japanese army successfully expelled \\nthe British from Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\\nThe Japanese government handed over total \\ncontrol of this territory to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nThis became the first Indian territory\\nto be freed from the British Empire.\\nOn 30th December 1943,\\nthe national Tricoloured flag was hoisted in \\nPort Blair by Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nIn 1944, his provisional government signed \\nan Indo-Japanese loan agreement with Japan.\\nIn the negotiations, he insisted that\\nIndia was not Japan\\'s client,\\nbut a temporarily weak, co-equal government and army.\\nAccording to this, Japan gave a loan of 100 million yen to India,\\nbut Netaji used only 10 million yen.\\nOn 7th January 1944,\\nNetaji relocated the headquarters of the \\nprovincial government from Singapore\\nto Rangoon, Burma.\\nHe was very close to India.\\nThe next target was to capture Imphal and Kohima.\\nIn March 1944, an offensive began there.\\nIt was one of the toughest land battles of World War II.\\nThis battle lasted for 4.5 months,\\nfrom 3rd March 1944\\nto 18th July 1944.\\nAround 100,000 INA and Japanese soldiers were fighting on one side,\\nand on the other side, the ones fighting on \\nbehalf of the British were Indian as well,\\nthose in the British Indian Army.\\nInitially, INA was quite successful.\\nIndian Flag was hoisted in Manipur\\'s Moirang.\\nThis was the first tricolour hoisting on the Indian mainland.\\nBut soon, things started falling apart.\\nNetaji\\'s entire plan was rained upon.\\nIn May that year,\\nthe rainy season had arrived early.\\nBecause of this, it was difficult to fight in the rain and mud.\\nOn the other hand, the Japanese Army was \\nlosing against America in the Pacific Ocean.\\nSo, INA forces did not have substantial air cover.\\nThe British had a crucial advantage.\\nThe British ships attacked the supply lines.\\nFood rations were running low.\\nThe INA soldiers and the Japanese soldiers there\\nhad to eat grass and wild flowers to survive.\\n6th July 1944.\\nIt had been two years since Gandhi was released from jail.\\nNetaji broadcast an address on the radio,\\n\"Father of our nation,\\nIn this holy war for India\\'s liberation,\\nwe ask for your blessings and good wishes.\"\\nThis was the first time Gandhi ji was \\naddressed as the Father of the Nation.\\nThis is where this title comes from.\\nThis title was not given by no other than\\nSubhash Chandra Bose himself.\\n10th July 1944,\\nthe Japanese informed Netaji that\\nhis military position cannot be defended.\\nThere is no other option other than retreating.\\nAfter the failure of the Imphal attack,\\nthe INA troops marched back to Burma.\\nOn 21st August 1944,\\nNetaji publicly acknowledged \\nthe failure of the Imphal campaign.\\nHe said that due to the quick arrival of the rainy season\\nand the defects in the supply system,\\nthey had to face setbacks.\\nAfter this, Netaji returned to Singapore\\nand tried to rebuild the INA.\\nWhat happened next?\\nHow was this movement continued?\\nWhat else did Netaji do?\\nAnd what was the important role played by the soldiers of INA\\nlater in India\\'s independence?\\nLet\\'s talk about these\\nin the next part of this video.\\nBecause this video has become too long.\\nFor now, if you liked the video,\\nyou can go and watch the Quit India Movement video.\\nBecause the story in this video played out outside India\\nfrom 1942 to 1944.\\nBut what was going on in India at that time?\\nWhat were the rest of the freedom fighters doing?\\nI have talked about all these in this video.\\nYou can click here to watch it.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}',

text='Hello, friends!\\nOn 9th February 1943,\\na German submarine departed \\nfrom the city of Kiel, Germany.\\nAlthough it carried the Nazi soldiers in it,\\nan Indian was also present among them.\\nAn Indian whose name was Matsuda.\\nThis submarine was tasked with \\nthe mission to travel Southward,\\nto go around Africa\\nand transfer Mr. Matsuda to a Japanese submarine.\\nIt sounds easy,\\nbut it was not without danger\\nThe sea route was full of British ships.\\nAnd this was during the World War II\\nwhen Germany and Japan \\nwere fighting against the British.\\nOn 26th April 1943,\\nafter a journey of about two and a half months,\\nwhen this German submarine \\nreached the coast of Madagascar,\\na Japanese submarine was spotted in front of it.\\nBut the sea was so stormy that\\nit could have been dangerous for \\nthese two submarines to get closer.\\nSo for the next two days, these submarines\\nkept moving in parallel.\\nFinally, when the weather cleared,\\nMr. Matsuda emerged from the submarine.\\nOn a small raft, paddling and drenched,\\nhe reached the Japanese submarine,\\nwhere he was welcomed by Captain Masao Teraoka.\\nYou may be wondering\\nwhy these German and Japanese submarines\\nwere helping an Indian during World War II.\\nThis is because, Mr. Matsuda is none other than\\nour Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nUnknowingly perhaps, \\nduring this historic journey,\\nhe became the first Indian\\nto travel in a submarine.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose is one \\nof the greatest freedom fighters of India\\nand his story is full of such amazing stories.\\nHow he escaped under the nose of the British government\\nwent to Germany, met Hitler,\\nwent to Russia and Japan,\\nmet the Japanese Prime Minister,\\nwent to Singapore, formed his own army.\\nAnd even while staying outside India,\\nhe launched the biggest war on \\nthe British government occupying India. \\nLet\\'s understand his story in this video.\\nLet\\'s start our story with 1939,\\nthe year when World War II started.\\nViceroy Lord Linlithgow\\ndeclared war on behalf of India\\nwithout consulting any Indian.\\nThis was an embarrassing situation for Congress.\\nAnd under the Government of India Act,\\nCongress had some control over the ministries\\nand so they resigned from their positions.\\nMeanwhile, Subhash Chandra Bose \\nwas organizing his own party,\\nThe Forward Bloc.\\nAlthough this party was formed from within the Congress,\\nbut by the year 1940,\\nit was separated from the Congress\\'s main organization.\\nThere were two reasons behind this.\\nFirst, Subhash Chandra Bose was \\nbecoming too vocal about his leftist ideology,\\nwhich wasn\\'t appreciated by the other leaders of Congress.\\nI have talked about this in detail \\nin the video on Gandhi versus Bose.\\nThe link is in the description \\nin case you haven\\'t watched it yet.\\nAnd the second reason was that Bose wanted\\nto use World War II for India\\'s benefit.\\nHe wanted to take action quickly\\nand breaking off from Congress \\nhad become a necessity for him.\\nIn July 1940,\\nBose was leading a march in Calcutta\\nbecause of which he was arrested by the British government.\\nBeing in jail, he challenged the government\\nby launching a hunger strike.\\n\"Release me, or I shall refuse to live.\"\\nHe made a straightforward announcement.\\n\"In 1940, he was languishing in prison.\\nSo he gave an ultimatum to the British government\\nand undertook a fast unto d3ath.\"\\nGradually, his health deteriorated.\\nAnd in just one week, the government decided\\nto release him from jail\\nand put him under house arrest.\\nThe government did not want to be blamed\\nif Subhash Chandra Bose were to d!e in jail.\\nSo they thought that as long as he was in poor health,\\nhe should be under house arrest.\\nAnd as soon as his health improved,\\nthey wanted to throw him back in jail.\\nBut Netaji was devising his own plans.\\nHis plan was to go to Germany\\nand ask the Germans for help\\nto fight against the British.\\nBut how could he reach Germany?\\nBose contacted a communist organization in Punjab\\nto find out if there was a way\\nto cross the border and reach Germany secretly.\\nHe was told that there was a way.\\nTo enter through Afghanistan,\\nand go to the Soviet Union,\\nfrom there he could go to Germany.\\nOn 16th January 1941,\\nat around 1.30 AM,\\nwhen the city was sleeping,\\nNetaji sneaked out of his house\\nwith his nephew, Shishir Kumar Bose.\\nHe was in disguise.\\nHe was pretending to be an insurance agent,\\nMuhammad Ziauddin.\\nTogether with Shishir, they drove through the dark all night\\nand reached Dhanbad at around 8.30 AM.\\nThey spend a night at Shishir\\'s brother Ashok\\'s house\\nand the next day, from the nearby Gomo station,\\nBose boarded the train Kalka Mail.\\nThis train reached Delhi first\\nand there, he took another train to go to Peshawar,\\nthe Frontier Mail.\\nIn Peshawar, he was received by\\nthe provincial leader of the Forward Bloc, \\nMian Akbar Shah.\\nThe next step was to leave the territory occupied by the British.\\nTo do this, he changed his disguise.\\nInstead of Mohammad Ziauddin,\\nhe became a deaf and mute Pathan man.\\nIt was necessary to be deaf and mute because\\nBose could not speak Pashto.\\nSo, if anyone came to check them at the border,\\nthe person accompanying him could tell them\\nthat he was a deaf and mute Pathan.\\nHe travelled with another leader of \\nthe Forward Bloc, Bhagat Ram Talwar,\\nand both pretended that they were going to \\nthe shrine of Adda Sharif in Afghanistan.\\nTo pray that they could speak and hear.\\nOn 26th January 1941,\\nthey left Peshawar\\nand crossed the border of the British Empire by evening.\\nBy the morning of 29th January,\\nthey had reached Adda Sharif\\nand completed the journey to Kabul in trucks and tanks.\\nIt took Netaji 15 days to reach Kabul from Calcutta.\\nBut the British government found out about his escape\\n12 days after the fact.\\nThis is because the people at his home,\\nconstantly delivered food to his room.\\nAnd his other nephews would simply eat his food.\\nPeople believed that Netaji was still in his room.\\nSince the food was delivered and eaten regularly.\\nHis escape was so secret that\\neven his mother didn\\'t know about it.\\nIt was only on 27th January\\nwhen a case was to be heard against \\nSubhash Chandra Bose in the court.\\nAnd when he did not appear at the court,\\nhis two nephews informed the police\\nthat he was not at home.\\nOn 27th January, the news of his \\ndisappearance was published in the newspaper,\\nin Anand Bazaar Patrika and Hindustan Herald.\\nAfter which Reuters picked up on it\\nand this news spread all over the world.\\nMany reports were made to the British intelligence.\\nOne report said that he was on a ship going to Japan,\\nanother said something else\\nbut none of the reports were correct.\\nA ship going to Japan from Calcutta \\nwas searched by the British.\\nBut there was no sign of Bose.\\nSubhash had told his nephew Shishir that\\nif the news of his escape could be a secret for 4-5 days,\\nit would be impossible to catch him after that.\\nAnd this was true because\\nafter that, the British government could not catch him again.\\nAfter reaching Kabul, Netaji went \\nto the Soviet embassy to ask for help.\\nBut he didn\\'t get any help from there\\nbecause the Russians mistook him to be a British agent\\nwho wanted to infiltrate the Soviet Union.\\nThen he tried to contact the German embassy.\\nHans Pilger, a German minister who was \\npresent at the embassy at that time,\\nsent a telegram to the German foreign minister\\non 5th February,\\nsaying that after meeting Subhash,\\nhe had advised him to\\nstay hidden in the market with his Indian friends\\nand on his behalf,\\nthe German minister would contact the Russian ambassador.\\nA few days later, Netaji received a message that\\nif he wanted to leave Afghanistan,\\nhe should meet the Italian ambassador.\\nThis meeting took place on 22nd February, 1941,\\nAnd on 10th March, Bose was asked to\\nget a new Italian passport.\\nBose was given a new Italian passport\\nwith a new Italian identity.\\nThis was the photo on his Italian passport\\nand his new name was Orlando Mazzotta.\\nIn the meantime, the British government had \\nintercepted an Italian diplomatic communication\\nand they had found out that\\nBose was in Kabul.\\nThey also found out that he was planning \\nto go to Germany through the Middle East.\\nTwo special operations executives of \\nBritish intelligence were tasked with\\nfinding Bose in Turkey and k!lling him before he reached Germany.\\nBut Netaji was one step ahead.\\nHe never went to the Middle East.\\nInstead, he went to Moscow using his new identity. \\nFrom Moscow, he finally boarded a train to Berlin,\\nand on 2nd April 1941,\\nhe reached the German capital, Berlin.\\nHere, Netaji had 3 objectives.\\nFirst, to set up an Indian government in exile.\\nSecond, to find a way for his voice to reach the people.\\nAnd third, to establish an army\\nmade up of Indians,\\nthose Indians who were prisoners of war.\\nNow let\\'s see one-by-one how Netaji worked on these\\nand how he met the German dictator, Hitler.\\nThe biggest struggle was that Germany\\nhad to give a diplomatic recognition to India.\\nHe wanted Germany and the other Axis Powers\\nto officially declare India to be a free country.\\nAnd to make India\\'s independence on of their war aims.\\nBut Germany never gave such a declaration\\nbecause Hitler was not comfortable with this idea.\\nIn his infamous book Mein Kampf, \\nHitler stated his opinion about India.\\nHe wrote that he admired the British government\\nfor the way they have dominated and administered India.\\nAnd despite having German blood,\\nin spite of everything,\\nhe wrote that he wanted to see India under British rule.\\nNot only that, Hitler made fun of Indian freedom fighters\\nby calling them Asiatic jugglers.\\nIndia\\'s fight for freedom was a joke to Hitler.\\nBut still, Hitler wanted to use Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\nagainst the British in WWII.\\nNetaji was fully aware that\\nhis relationship with the Nazi Germany\\nwas merely a transactional relationship.\\nBoth sides saw their benefit,\\nthat\\'s why the relationship existed.\\nOtherwise, it wouldn\\'t.\\nWith this, he started working.\\nHe made plans on how\\nIndia can collaborate with the Axis Powers.\\nHe established a Free India Center in Berlin.\\nAnd then he submitted a memorandum to Hitler,\\nasking Hitler to attack India with his army,\\nso that the British could be removed from there.\\nIt would be akin to attacking the heart of the British Empire.\\nHe tried to manipulate the situation\\nto incite Hitler into taking his army\\nand fighting the British in India.\\nBut that had no positive result.\\nThe main reason was that Hitler \\nwas not concerned about India\\'s freedom.\\nBut there was another German who was \\nactually quite interested in helping Bose.\\nAdam von Trot,\\nhead of the India section of the Foreign Office in Berlin.\\nWith his help, this Foreign Office\\nwas turned into a Special India Division.\\nA few months later, on 2nd November 1941,\\nBose established the Free India Centre there.\\nIn fact, on this very road, \\nthat building you see there,\\nused to be the office of the Free India Centre.\\nToday, that\\'s just a cafe.\\nThere is no sign of it being an office before.\\nOn the other side, there is the Spanish embassy.\\nIn the first meeting at this centre, \\n6 decisions were made.\\nFirst, the name of the struggle \\nwas to be Azad Hind or Free India.\\nSecond, in Europe, the name of this organisation would be\\nAzad Hind Centre.\\nThird, the national anthem of our country would be Jana Gana Mana.\\nFourth, the emblem of the movement\\nwould be in tricolour with a springing tiger.\\nFifth, Indians would greet each other \\nwith the slogan of Jai Hind.\\nAnd the sixth, Subhash Chandra Bose would be given the title\\nNetaji.\\nOn 20th May 1941,\\nNetaji submitted a detailed plan to the German government\\non how to work on propaganda against \\nBritish imperialism all over the world.\\nA part of this plan was Azad Hind Radio.\\nOn 19th February 1942,\\nNetaji decided to give up the identity of Orlando Mazotta.\\nHe dropped it\\nand revealed his real identity to the world.\\nHe broadcast his first message \\nto the world through Azad Hind Radio.\\nThis is Subhash Chandra Bose\\nspeaking to you over Azad Hind Radio.\\nAnd starting in February 1942,\\nit began to be broadcast to the Indian population too.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose\\'s first address \\nto his countrymen through this radio was\\nthat everyone would continue with the struggle.\\nAnd that the Axis powers would soon help them in their mission\\nand together, they would fight against British imperialism.\\n\"Brothers and sisters,\\nthe struggle for freedom that we have started,\\nwe need to continue it until\\nwe get complete independence.\"\\nApart from the radio, a monthly journal was started,\\ncalled Azad Hind,\\nwith copies being rolled out starting in March 1942.\\nWithin a few days,\\n5,000 copies were circulated in Germany.\\nBut there were problems working on the third motive.\\nThe army that Bose wanted to create\\nhe wanted it to be called the Indian National Army.\\nBut the Nazi government refused to \\nrecognise a new independent army.\\nThat\\'s why this military unit was named\\nIndian Legion.\\nBose met more than 10,000 \\nprisoners of war and talked to them.\\nHe couldn\\'t convince everyone.\\nBut about half of the people were convinced to join his army.\\nSo, the strength of the Indian Legion \\nwas about 5,000 people.\\nEven though this army was small \\nin many ways, it was historic.\\nBecause Netaji had successfully brought people \\ntogether despite their castes and religious beliefs.\\nCaptain Walter Harbich,\\nthe one in charge of the training camp at that time,\\nnoted that\\n\"His Excellency, Netaji\\'s goal was to\\nparalyse the century-old antagonisms\\nrooted in the Indian nationalities,\\nreligions and castes,\\nand to unite the members of both these units\\nin one great common aim.\\n26th August, 1942.\\nIndian Legion took its oath and with that,\\nNetaji was almost successful in \\nfulfilling his goals in Germany.\\nExcept for one thing,\\nThe Axis powers were still\\nnot declaring India as independent yet.\\nThe reason was Hitler\\'s negative attitude towards Indians.\\nA few months ago, in May 1942,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose managed to meet Adolf Hitler.\\nAfter this meeting,\\nNetaji was convinced that Hitler was \\nmore interested in propaganda victories\\nas compared to actually winning with military strength.\\nThat\\'s why Netaji turned his attention towards Japan.\\nTill then, news had already reached Japan\\nthat an army of Indians was being formed in Germany\\nto oust the British from of India.\\nJapanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo had taken note of it.\\nSince early 1942, he had been saying that\\nit was time for Indians to stand up against British rule.\\nIf you want to know about the World War II stories in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks for that on KUKU FM.\\nLike this one on Joseph Stalin,\\nthe leader of the Soviet Union during World War II.\\nOr this one on Alan Turing,\\na genius who cracked the German code\\nand helped the British in this world war.\\nKUKU FM is generally a great platform for audio-learning\\non it, you can find audiobooks on almost any topic.\\nWhether it is history, politics, mythology or even fiction.\\nListening to audiobooks is the best when\\nyou are walking or doing some chores at home.\\nIf you haven\\'t joined KUKU FM yet,\\nthere is a special 50% off coupon in the description below.\\nYou can check it out.\\nNow let\\'s get back to the topic.\\nIn February 1942, Japan\\ndefeated the British in Singapore\\nand occupied Singapore.\\nAround 40,000 Indians who were fighting \\non behalf of the British side in Singapore,\\nafter Japan\\'s takeover, became Japan\\'s prisoners of war.\\nHere, Netaji saw another opportunity.\\nWhy not include those people in his army too?\\nIn the midst of all this, in August 1942,\\nMahatma Gandhi announced the Quit India Movement.\\nIn India, hundreds of thousands of people\\nwere ready for the revolution against the British government.\\nWhen this news reached Netaji,\\nhe was happy to hear it.\\nThrough Azad Hind Radio, he sent his message\\nthat all Indians should support Gandhi ji.\\nHe called the movement India\\'s non-violent guerilla warfare.\\nEven though a few years ago, there were \\ndisagreements in Gandhi ji and Netaji\\'s views.\\nTheir opinions often clashed.\\nBut at this point in time,\\nthey supported each other.\\nOn 31st August 1942,\\nwhen Netaji found out that people like \\nSavarkar and Jinnah\\nwere against the Quit India Movement,\\nthis is what he had to say on Azad Hind Radio.\\n\"I would request Mr Jinnah and Mr Savarkar\\nand all those leaders who still \\nthink of a compromise with the Britishers,\\nTo realize for once and all\\nthat in the world of tomorrow \\nthere would be no British Empire.\\nHe addressed leaders like Jinnah and Savarkar\\nand told them that there was no future for the British Empire.\\nThe last time Gandhi ji and Netaji met in person was in 1940.\\nIn that meeting, Gandhi ji told Netaji,\\nthat if Netaji\\'s could successfully free India, \\nthe first telegram congratulating \\nhim would be from Gandhi ji.\\nThis incident was written by Netaji \\nin his book, The Indian Struggle.\\nThough, their ideologies and ways were different,\\nthey greatly admired each other.\\nGandhi ji was fighting in India\\nand Netaji was fighting from outside India.\\n8th February 1943,\\nNetaji appointed his friend ACN Nambiar in charge \\nof the Indian Legion and Azad Hind Centre.\\nAnd he left Germany to head towards Japan.\\nThis time, he didn\\'t take a land route.\\nInstead, he dove into the water,\\nin a German submarine.\\nU-180 German Submarine.\\nOnce again, he changed his disguise\\nand become Mr. Matsuda.\\nI had talked about this story at the beginning of the video.\\nBy the way, he was not the only Indian to sit in the submarine.\\nHe was accompanied by another leader of the Indian Legion,\\nAbid Hasan Safrani.\\nTwo and a half months later, on the coast of Madagascar,\\nboth of them changed the submarine\\nand were welcomed in the Japanese submarine.\\nOn May 8th, 1943,\\nthis submarine reached Sabang,\\nwhich is part of present-day Indonesia.\\nFrom there, they took a flight to Tokyo\\nand on May 16th, they reached Japan.\\nNetaji met with the Japanese Prime Minister, Tojo twice.\\nThe first time was on 10th June and the second on 14th June.\\nIn their second meeting, Netaji openly asked him,\\nif Japan would help the Indian independence movement unconditionally?\\nHe wanted to confirm that\\nJapan would help India with no strings attached.\\nIn Germany, Hitler did not agree to this \\neven after months of effort,\\nbut this one question was enough in Japan.\\nTojo immediately agreed to help Netaji.\\nJapan\\'s support was public for the entire world to see.\\nTwo days later, on 16th June, Bose attended the \\n82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet.\\nAnd there, Prime Minister Tojo gave a historic address.\\n\"India has been for centuries under England\\'s rule.\"\\nHe joined India\\'s aspiration for complete independence.\\nHe claimed that Japan would do everything possible\\nto help Indian independence.\\n\"I am convinced the day of Indian freedom \\nand prosperity is not far off.\"\\nAfter this, Subhash Chandra Bose gave a statement\\nwhich was recorded on video.\\nWe have very few real video footage of Netaji.\\nThis is one of them.\\nHave a look.\\nThere was another freedom fighter in Japan \\nwho invited Subhash Chandra Bose\\nRash Behari Bose.\\nHere, I would like to tell you an interesting fact\\nthat he was actually the leader of the \\nIndian National Army at this point in time.\\nYou might be thinking, how could this be possible?\\nThe INA was made by Netaji,\\nbut no.\\nThe INA actually existed even before Netaji went to Japan.\\nThe first Indian National Army was actually formed by\\nGeneral Mohan Singh in February 1942,\\nwhen Singapore fell into the hands of Japan.\\nThis INA operated till December 1942,\\nafter which Mohan Singh disbanded this army\\nbecause of disputes with the Japanese.\\nThe reason was that the Japanese wanted\\nthe Indian National Army to fight on their behalf in Southeast Asia.\\nJust like the British made them their pawns.\\nMany Indians refused to do this\\nand so those units were shut down\\nand Mohan Singh was taken into custody by the Japanese.\\nThis is where Rash Behari Bose entered the narrative.\\nHe acted as a leader and stoped \\nthe INA from completely disbanding.\\nWith Rash Behari Bose, Subhash Chandra \\nBose reached Singapore on 2nd July\\nand were warmly welcomed with garlands.\\nRam Singh Thakuri played a song when they came out of the plane.\\nYou can watch another original video here.\\n\"The one India is proud of,\\nthe pride of India is here.\\nSubhash is the life of India.\\nSubhash is the pride of India.\\nSubhash ji, Subhash ji,\\nhe is the life of India.\"\\nAnd here, the command of the \\nremaining INA was given to Netaji.\\nThis was a very historic moment because\\nmany Indians had gathered in Singapore\\'s Padang\\nto listen to Netaji.\\nHere, he gave an inspiring speech.\\nA speech where he used the slogan \\'Chalo Dilli\\'. \\n[Let\\'s March To Delhi]\\n[Victory to Subhash Chandra Bose]\\nThere were around 13,000 soldiers in \\nthe Indian National Army in Singapore.\\nNetaji\\'s plan was to first expand the army.\\nHe wanted to gather 50,000 soldiers first.\\nAnd later, to form a strong army of \\n3 million people.\\nThe Japanese government was shocked to hear this plan.\\nThey said that they could not \\nprovide weapons to so many people.\\nThey could provide weapons to about 30,000 people only.\\nBut for Netaji, this was not \\na fight to be fought with weapons only.\\nHe wanted that eventually,\\nthe average citizens of the nation should be a part of his army.\\nAnd then, together, the Indians would overthrow the British.\\nThere were similarities between this faction \\nand the Indian Legion in Germany.\\nThe soldiers in INA were from various religious backgrounds,\\nbut there was no discrimination among them.\\nThe motto of the Indian National Army \\nwas made up of three Urdu words:\\nIttefaq, Itmaad, and Qurbani\\nwhich means Unity, Faith, and Sacrifice.\\nIn total, the INA was divided into five regiments\\nand these five regiments were named\\nafter five freedom fighters.\\nGandhi, Nehru,\\nMaulana Azad, Subhash,\\nand Rani of Jhansi.\\nEven the campaign poster of the INA\\nwhich had the phrase, Chalo Dilli,\\nhad a photo of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nOn another poster, there were quotes from both \\nSubhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi.\\nBut today, there are people who\\nspread fake news on WhatsApp to show that\\nthese two opposed each other.\\nOn 7th August 1943,\\nNetaji clearly said in a radio address,\\neven though Gandhi supported non-violence,\\nhe was ready to give his full support to the Indian National Army.\\nAnd more significant than this was the fact that\\nGandhi\\'s followers would also support them.\\nOn 2nd October 1943,\\nNetaji gave another message to Gandhi ji through the radio.\\nHe said that Mahatma Gandhi\\'s services to India\\nwere unique and unparalleled,\\nthat his name should be written in \\ngold in our national history, forever.\\nNo single person could achieve as much in their life\\nunder those circumstances,\\nas much as Gandhi had achieved.\\nGandhiji reciprocated Netaji\\'s admiration\\nby giving him the title of Prince of the Patriots.\\nOn 21st August 1943,\\nNetaji set up the Provisionary Government \\nof Azad Hind in Singapore.\\nHe became the head of this provincial government.\\nHe said that it was not a normal government,\\nthat their mission was unique.\\nThey were a fighting organization\\nand they planned to declare war against the British government.\\n\"The skies reverberated with full throated shouts of\\nJai Hind!\"\\nBy then, Netaji did not have any territory,\\nbut the Indian diaspora living in South East Asia,\\nwas officially under his jurisdiction.\\nThe government established in Singapore \\nhad the right to collect taxes,\\nenforce laws and even\\nrecruit soldiers for their army.\\nTwo months later, in December 1943,\\nthe Japanese army successfully expelled \\nthe British from Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\\nThe Japanese government handed over total \\ncontrol of this territory to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nThis became the first Indian territory\\nto be freed from the British Empire.\\nOn 30th December 1943,\\nthe national Tricoloured flag was hoisted in \\nPort Blair by Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nIn 1944, his provisional government signed \\nan Indo-Japanese loan agreement with Japan.\\nIn the negotiations, he insisted that\\nIndia was not Japan\\'s client,\\nbut a temporarily weak, co-equal government and army.\\nAccording to this, Japan gave a loan of 100 million yen to India,\\nbut Netaji used only 10 million yen.\\nOn 7th January 1944,\\nNetaji relocated the headquarters of the \\nprovincial government from Singapore\\nto Rangoon, Burma.\\nHe was very close to India.\\nThe next target was to capture Imphal and Kohima.\\nIn March 1944, an offensive began there.\\nIt was one of the toughest land battles of World War II.\\nThis battle lasted for 4.5 months,\\nfrom 3rd March 1944\\nto 18th July 1944.\\nAround 100,000 INA and Japanese soldiers were fighting on one side,\\nand on the other side, the ones fighting on \\nbehalf of the British were Indian as well,\\nthose in the British Indian Army.\\nInitially, INA was quite successful.\\nIndian Flag was hoisted in Manipur\\'s Moirang.\\nThis was the first tricolour hoisting on the Indian mainland.\\nBut soon, things started falling apart.\\nNetaji\\'s entire plan was rained upon.\\nIn May that year,\\nthe rainy season had arrived early.\\nBecause of this, it was difficult to fight in the rain and mud.\\nOn the other hand, the Japanese Army was \\nlosing against America in the Pacific Ocean.\\nSo, INA forces did not have substantial air cover.\\nThe British had a crucial advantage.\\nThe British ships attacked the supply lines.\\nFood rations were running low.\\nThe INA soldiers and the Japanese soldiers there\\nhad to eat grass and wild flowers to survive.\\n6th July 1944.\\nIt had been two years since Gandhi was released from jail.\\nNetaji broadcast an address on the radio,\\n\"Father of our nation,\\nIn this holy war for India\\'s liberation,\\nwe ask for your blessings and good wishes.\"\\nThis was the first time Gandhi ji was \\naddressed as the Father of the Nation.\\nThis is where this title comes from.\\nThis title was not given by no other than\\nSubhash Chandra Bose himself.\\n10th July 1944,\\nthe Japanese informed Netaji that\\nhis military position cannot be defended.\\nThere is no other option other than retreating.\\nAfter the failure of the Imphal attack,\\nthe INA troops marched back to Burma.\\nOn 21st August 1944,\\nNetaji publicly acknowledged \\nthe failure of the Imphal campaign.\\nHe said that due to the quick arrival of the rainy season\\nand the defects in the supply system,\\nthey had to face setbacks.\\nAfter this, Netaji returned to Singapore\\nand tried to rebuild the INA.\\nWhat happened next?\\nHow was this movement continued?\\nWhat else did Netaji do?\\nAnd what was the important role played by the soldiers of INA\\nlater in India\\'s independence?\\nLet\\'s talk about these\\nin the next part of this video.\\nBecause this video has become too long.\\nFor now, if you liked the video,\\nyou can go and watch the Quit India Movement video.\\nBecause the story in this video played out outside India\\nfrom 1942 to 1944.\\nBut what was going on in India at that time?\\nWhat were the rest of the freedom fighters doing?\\nI have talked about all these in this video.\\nYou can click here to watch it.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}',

text='Hello, friends!\\n16th August, 1945.\\nWorld War II was on the verge of ending.\\nJapan had laid down their weapons and surrendered.\\nAnd in Germany, Hitler took his own life.\\nGermany and Japan, both countries\\nhad lost this war terribly.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose,\\nwho was taking Japan\\'s help to \\nlead the Indian National Army since 1943,\\nwas looking for new ways\\nto continue the freedom struggle.\\nEven though the plans weren\\'t properly laid out,\\nhis associates knew that\\nNetaji wanted to shift his base into the Soviet Union.\\nHis plan was to first go to Tokyo\\nto thank the Japanese Government\\nand leave for Soviet from there.\\nThe reason for this was very simple.\\nThe Soviet Union was a part of the Allied Forces.\\nThe countries that won this war.\\nBut despite this, the Soviet was\\nideologically different from other \\nallied countries like the US and the UK.\\nDue to his Communist ideology, Netaji hoped\\nthat they would help India \\nin our fight against the British.\\nBut the problem was that \\nJapan\\'s loss was still fresh.\\nAnd there had been two nuclear \\nattacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nSo there weren\\'t many options for Netaji to travel to Tokyo.\\nThe Japanese forces found a way for him to travel\\nthat looked like this.\\nHe would board a Mitsubishi \\nKi-21 Heavy Bomber aircraft,\\nthat would take off from Saigon in Vietnam.\\nThis aircraft would make a stop in Taiwan\\'s Heito,\\nfrom there, it would fly to Taihoku Prefecture\\npresent-day Taipei in Taiwan.\\nAnd then one last stop in China\\'s Manchuria territory,\\nbefore finally reaching the final destination, Tokyo.\\nBack in those days, Manchuria was\\na puppet state of Japan, known as Manchukuo.\\nBut from 9th August,\\nthe Soviet Union started invading this place.\\nNetaji knew this,\\nso he thought that\\nhe should establish his first contact \\nwith the Soviets in Manchukuo.\\nFollowing this itinerary,\\nNetaji left Bangkok on the morning of 17th August\\nwith his INA group.\\nAnd reached Saigon, Vietnam around 10 AM.\\nUpon reaching here, he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people to sit \\nin the heavy bomber aircraft.\\nSo, it wasn\\'t possible for Netaji to go ahead \\nwith all his Indian National Army companions.\\nHe had to choose only one person.\\nHe chose to go on this journey with \\nhis companion Habibur Rahman.\\nOn 17th August around 5 PM,\\nthis plane took off from Saigon\\ncarrying about 12-13 people.\\nApart from Netaji and Colonel Habibur Rahman,\\nthe remaining passengers were either from \\nthe Japanese military or Japanese crew members.\\nBecause it was going to be dark soon,\\nthis plane made an unscheduled stop at Tourane,\\nwhich is the present-day Da Nang city.\\nThe passengers stayed the night at a hotel\\nand the crew worked on making this plane lighter.\\nMany weapons, ammunition, and machine guns\\nwere taken off the plane\\nso that it could be made lighter for the long journey.\\nNext morning on 18th August,\\nthe plane took off early at 5 AM.\\nAnd since the plane was lighter by then,\\nthe pilot skipped the next scheduled stop, Heito.\\nNext stop was Taihoku, the city of Taipei,\\nwhere the plane landed around 12 noon.\\nThe passengers had their lunch during the 2 hours stop\\nand the plane was refuelled.\\nDuring the plane\\'s testing,\\nthe pilot and the engineer saw that\\nthere was something wrong \\nwith the left engine of the plane.\\nThey didn\\'t investigate further,\\nthey thought it must be fine\\nsince the engine was fairly new.\\nOn 18th August, at 2 PM,\\nthe plane took off again.\\nJust a few minutes after the plane took off,\\na loud bang was heard.\\nAs if the plane\\'s engine had exploded.\\nThe plane started to go out of control\\nand it eventually crashed within a few seconds.\\nThe people in and near the cockpit,\\nthe pilot, co-pilot and a Japanese general,\\nd!ed immediately.\\nBehind the general, near the left wing,\\nnext to the plane\\'s petrol tank,\\nwas Netaji.\\nAnd behind him was Habibur Rahman.\\nSince both of them were towards the back of the plane,\\nmiraculously, after the crash,\\nthey came out of the plane alive.\\nBut Netaji was in a very bad condition, \\nbeing drenched in gasoline.\\nThe back door of the plane was not opening,\\nso they had to exit from the front entrance.\\nDoing this meant that\\nthey had to pass through the flames.\\nAnd since Netaji was completely drenched in petrol,\\nhe got burnt instantly.\\nHabibur Rahman tried his best to save him.\\nHe used clothes to put out the fire.\\nWithin 15 minutes, he takes Netaji \\nto the nearby Nammon Military Hospital.\\nBut unfortunately,\\nhe was unsuccessful in saving Netaji\\'s life.\\nThe d3ath of Subhash Chandra Bose\\ntook place in this hospital a few hours later.\\nThis painful story of the plane crash\\nis still merely a story for some people.\\nSome people believe that\\nNetaji had actually reached the Soviet Union\\nand he was imprisoned there\\nand tortured for the rest of his life.\\nOn the other hand, some people believe\\nthat this plane crash was just a ruse.\\nNetaji was actually alive\\nand he had returned to India in a disguise.\\nHe became a hermit in Ayodhya\\nand spent the rest of his life as a hermit.\\nGumnami Baba.\\nWhat\\'s the truth?\\nWhy is Netaji\\'s d3ath such a big mystery?\\nWhat was found when this was investigated?\\nLet\\'s try to understand these\\nin this video.\\nThis video is the second part\\non Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s story.\\nIf you haven\\'t seen the first video,\\nyou can find the link in the description below.\\nNow, before talking about which \\nconspiracy theory is true and which is not,\\nlet\\'s take a look at the pages of history.\\nOn an incident that is always ignored,\\nwhile talking about Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nI am talking about INA trials,\\nwhich took place on Delhi\\'s Red Fort \\non 5th November 1945.\\nThis is about 2.5 months after Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nMost of the Indian National Army troops\\nwere captured by the British.\\nApproximately 25,000 INA soldiers\\nwere in British custody.\\nOut of the 25,000, 3 soldiers\\nfaced a public case in Red Fort this day.\\n\"The British government decided that\\nin the eyes of the world,\\nto prove the Indian National Army a criminal group,\\nthere had to be an open trial in the Red Fort.\"\\nThese three soldiers were very special.\\nCaptain Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nLieutenant Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon,\\nand Captain Prem Kumar Sahgal.\\nDuring Netaji\\'s struggle over the last few years,\\nthe British Empire had cleverly\\nsuppressed all the news about the INA.\\nThis meant that most Indians did not know\\nthe extent of Netaji\\'s contributions.\\nBut when the INA troops were captured by the British,\\nthe British government decided to\\nportray these trials in a highly-publicised manner to the public.\\nThe news of the trials against these \\n3 soldiers\\' spread across the country.\\nThe British government believed that\\nsince Netaji\\'s INA had attacked the British government,\\npeople would see it as an attack against the country,\\npeople would treat the INA as traitors.\\nThey believed that the public support will be with the British\\nbecause the British government\\ntried to portray the British government as the country.\\nBut this plan backfired completely.\\nThe result was just the opposite.\\nMost people saw that\\nthe people who are labelled as traitors by the government\\nwere actually the biggest patriots.\\nThousands of people were out on the streets to protest.\\nThe common masses made their voices heard.\\nThey claimed that these soldiers should not be punished.\\nThe crowd of protesters soon reached the Red Fort.\\nInterestingly, these three officers\\nbelonged to three religions.\\nSahgal was a Hindu,\\nKhan was a Muslim,\\nand Dhillon was a Sikh.\\nIndia\\'s three major religious communities.\\nThe same religious harmony\\nthat was seen in Netaji Subhash \\nChandra Bose\\'s Indian National Army.\\nNow, it was there in front of the country in the Red Fort.\\nThese three soldiers became \\na symbol of religious and national unity.\\nA case was filed against these three\\nfor waging war against the nation\\nunder Section 121 of IPC.\\nAlong with charges of m*rder and abetment to m*rder.\\nBut seeing this attempt to label \\nthe freedom fighters as traitors,\\npeople were even more infuriated.\\nKolkata, the city where Netaji \\nhad spent many years of his life,\\nsaw the most violent protests.\\nOn 23rd November, in a police firing,\\naround 100 protesters were killed.\\nWhat was the Congress Party doing during this?\\nCongress established an INA defence committee.\\n\"On the advice of Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nthe Indian National Congress\\nhas established a high-level defence committee.\"\\nThey decided to legally defend \\nthese three soldiers in the court.\\nThe defence committee that was formed\\nincluded Tej Bahadur Sapru,\\nBhulabhai Desai,\\nAsaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru himself.\\nYou heard it right, Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nwho used to be a lawyer,\\nhad not worn the lawyer\\'s gown for many years.\\nBut at that point,\\nhe presented himself in the court as a lawyer.\\nThey argued in the British court that\\nthe provisional government created by Netaji\\nand the Indian National Army,\\nwas not illegal under international law.\\nBecause a state called Azad Hind \\n[Independent India] was created,\\nand its army had waged the war.\\nThey argued that the British \\ngovernment\\'s internal laws and regulations\\ncould not be imposed on Azad Hind and the INA.\\nObviously, since the British government \\nwas fighting in a British court,\\nthis legal fight was not successful.\\nOn 3rd January 1946,\\nwhen the court\\'s verdict was announced,\\nKhan, Sahgal, and Dhillon were \\nsentenced to transportation for life.\\nBasically, they are sent to exile\\nfrom where they would never return.\\nBut no court or government can withstand \\nthe power of the people.\\nThe people were so angry,\\nand the protests were relentless,\\nthat under public pressure, the government had to\\nrelease these soldiers.\\nThe British government was shocked to see\\nthat the soldiers of the British Indian Army\\nwere also revolting.\\nThose soldiers refused to fight,\\non behalf of the British.\\nThis later led to the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny.\\nThat is a story in itself,\\nwe can talk about that in another video.\\nBut because of these INA trials,\\nNetaji\\'s story had spread all over the country.\\nThe story of a man\\nwho had achieved such amazing feats in his life.\\nHow he could disguise himself repeatedly\\nto fool multiple countries.\\nHe went from one country to another to form an army.\\nSometimes in a submarine,\\nsometimes in an aeroplane.\\nThis story was no less than a superhero\\'s tale.\\nFor this reason, some people and \\nsome INA soldiers started doubting that\\nif Netaji had indeed d!ed in a plane crash.\\nThis didn\\'t seem probable.\\nHe had changed his disguises so many times,\\nfooled so many people,\\npeople started believing that \\nhe must be faking his d3ath too.\\nMaybe he used a body double in the plane crash.\\nBecause Allied Powers had already won World War II\\nand he did this to save himself from being captured.\\nOn top of that, there was no death certificate\\nnor any photo of the dead body.\\nThey had Habibur Rahman\\'s account only.\\nSo, it was understandable for people to have doubts.\\nEven when Mahatma Gandhi heard this news,\\nof Netaji\\'s plane having crashed,\\nhe too refused to believe that\\nNetaji could have died.\\nOnly after talking to Habibur Rahman personally,\\ndid Gandhi change his stance.\\nBut this doubt remained with many people in the country\\nand they kept waiting for the day\\nwhen Netaji would come back\\nand reveal himself to the public.\\nSome of them were Netaji\\'s associates.\\nAn organisation called Subhash Wadi Janta Party was formed\\nby some of these associates,\\nwho refuse to believe the plane crash theory.\\nAccording to their chronology, Netaji had come to India\\nand had become a hermit.\\nThey claim that he attended \\nGandhi ji\\'s cremation in 1948,\\nin disguise.\\nAnd then, from 1956 to 1959,\\nhe lived in a Shiva temple in Bareilly as a hermit.\\nThere, he is said to have become an expert in herbs\\nand even discovered the cure for tuberculosis.\\nIn 1959, Netahi is said to have\\nopened an ashram in Jalpaiguri city, Bengal.\\nShaulmari Ashram.\\nCalling himself Shreemad Saranandji.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nis called the Shaulmari Baba Theory.\\nThis ashram actually existed\\nand this Baba was also real.\\nIn the 1960s, this conspiracy theory spread so much that\\nShaulmari Baba had to clarify that\\nhe was not Netaji.\\nBut his followers still kept insisting,\\nthat he was Netaji \\neven though he claimed not to be.\\nAnother conspiracy theory that\\nwas developed by some other associates of Netaji\\nwas that the plane had actually landed\\nand he had reached the Soviet Union as planned.\\nBut in the Soviet, Netaji was captured by Russians\\nand then t0rtured in concentration camps.\\nThe Russians used this\\nas a leverage against Prime Minister Nehru.\\nIn fact, not only Nehru\\nbut even Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\\nwas threatened with this.\\nRussians said that if India did not side with the Soviet Union,\\nthey would release Netaji from jail\\nand let the whole world know.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nwas based on the misconception that\\nNetaji was a threat to Prime Minister Nehru\\nand opposed Congress.\\nAnd that if he were to return to India,\\nhe would have been the PM instead of Nehru.\\nThere is no rhyme nor reason \\nfor this conspiracy theory because\\nas I said in the previous video,\\nNetaji actually admired Nehru a lot.\\nThis is why he named on of the Azad Hind Brigade\\nafter Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nAnd the same mutual admiration\\nwas extended by Jawaharlal Nehru towards Netaji.\\nAfter his d3ath, he was called a national hero.\\nThere are some other interesting theories,\\nlike Netaji going to China,\\nand leading some operations there.\\nWe won\\'t talk about all that.\\nLet\\'s discuss the most popular theory about him.\\nThis is the theory of the Gumnami Baba.\\nHarvard professor Sugata Bose,\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nin his book His Majesty\\'s Opponent \\npublished in 2011,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose \\nand India\\'s Struggle Against Empire,\\nmentioned that in 2002,\\nthe judiciary asked him to donate 1 ml blood\\nso that his DNA could be compared to a Gumnami Baba\\'s.\\nThis was because some people were claiming\\nthat a Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThis was in 2002.\\n57 years since Netaji passed away.\\nHis family was shocked to know that\\neven government institutions were \\npromoting such a bizarre theory.\\nBut still, he donated his blood.\\nOf course, the evidence was negative.\\nThe DNA did not match.\\nBut still, the Gumnami Baba theory still remains popular.\\nThere are some people on social media\\nwho have taken up this theory again\\nand spread conspiracies repeatedly just for views.\\nThe theory of Gumnami Baba actually started in Russia.\\nThat under Stalin\\'s government\\nhe used to carry out top-secret covert operations.\\nLike a one-man army.\\nIn the Korean war of 1952,\\nhe is said to have led the Asian Liberation Army.\\nAfter that, in the war of 1962,\\nhe is said to have led the Chinese army against India\\nbecause he wanted to remove all western influence from India.\\nAnd since Indians didn\\'t recognise Gumnami Baba,\\nhe asked the army to retreat.\\nThe story doesn\\'t end here.\\nAfter this, in 1969, Gumnami Baba\\nfought against the USA in Vietnam.\\nIn 1971, he played a major role \\nin liberating Bangladesh.\\nHe was also guiding Mukti Vahini.\\nAnd finally, after everything,\\nhe became a hermit in India.\\nSpecifically, a hermit living in Ayodhya.\\nWho passed away on 16th September 1985.\\nThere was no photo of this Gumnami Baba\\'s d3ath,\\nnor was there any official d3ath certificate.\\nBut 44 days after his d3ath,\\na local newspaper published the news.\\nThe newspaper published that\\nthe Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThe newspaper was called Naye Log [New People].\\nSenior journalist Sheetla Singh,\\nwho was working with another local newspaper at that time,\\nnamed Jan Morcha,\\ninvestigated this story in November 1985.\\nFor his investigation,\\nhe went to Kolkata to meet a close friend of Netaji,\\nPabitra Mohan Roy,\\nformer Intelligence Officer of INA.\\nHe said that throughout the years\\nhe met a new hermit, or a new mysterious person\\nin his search of Netaji.\\nIn this attempt, he went from Kohima to Punjab,\\nfrom Faizabad to Ayodhya.\\nBut none of the Babas were Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nHere you might get confused\\nI talked about a few Babas earlier\\nso why was this person meeting different Babas every year.\\nActually, friends, this Baba angle\\nhas multiple versions.\\nMany claims by different people.\\nSomeone in Karnataka may claim that a certain Babas was Netaji,\\nsomeone may claim that in UP,\\nand someone in MP.\\nWhen this news was published in Jan Morcha\\nabout Gumnami Baba theory,\\na fight broke out in the media.\\nMany local newspapers in Uttar Pradesh,\\nstarted talking about\\nhow Gumnami Baba was like.\\nEveryone started claiming that he was Netaji.\\nSome people started saying that\\nthey had known for years \\nthat Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nBut because he had taken an oath\\nthat they could not tell anyone about this,\\nso they had to remain silent.\\nQuite ironic because actually\\nhad they actually taken an oath\\nthat they would not tell this to anyone\\nwhy would they talk about it now?\\nIf you think logically about this theory,\\nit doesn\\'t make any sense.\\nWhat would be Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s motivation\\nto hide his identity?\\nIf he really was Gumnami Baba,\\nthen why would he be in a disguise\\nand spend the rest of his life as a hermit?\\nSome people on social media claim that\\nthis was done to protect India\\'s geopolitical interests.\\nHad Netaji come in front of the public,\\nit wouldn\\'t have been good for India.\\nI don\\'t understand their strange logic.\\nI think some people spread such \\nconspiracy theories for attention and views.\\nAnother argument in favour of the Gumnami Baba Theory is that\\nthis Baba used to speak English fluently.\\nHe used to discuss geopolitical issues with great confidence.\\nThat\\'s why he could be none other than Netaji.\\nBut today, look around you.\\nThere are so many Babas\\nwho talk in English with great confidence.\\nHave discussions on geopolitical issues.\\nWould you ever say that they are not a Baba,\\nbut Albert Einstein in disguise?\\nI don\\'t want to counter these theories with jokes.\\nI want to show you the truth with proof.\\nBecause in the last 70 years,\\nmultiple investigations have been carried out on this.\\nA lot of inquiries have been conducted\\nand many reports have been published.\\nLet\\'s understand these reports one-by-one\\nand try to find out the truth.\\nThe first was the Figgess Report of 1946.\\nThis was an investigation by the British.\\nUnder Lord Mountbatten,\\nintelligence officer Colonel John Figgess\\nwas tasked with investigating the \\nd3ath of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nFiggess submitted his report on 25th July 1946.\\nThis report remained confidential for many decades.\\nBut today, it is publicly available.\\nThis report confirms four things.\\nFirst, a plane crashed on 18th August 1945\\nnear Taihoku airport.\\nSecond, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was in the plane.\\nThird, Netaji d!ed in a nearby \\nmilitary hospital on the same day.\\nFourth, he was cremated in Taihoku\\nand his ashes were later sent to Tokyo.\\nThe most important testimony in this report\\nwas of a Japanese doctor, \\nToyoshi Tsuruta,\\nwho was working in Nammon Hospital that day.\\nThe hospital where Netaji was taken after the crash.\\nIt is written in this report that\\nNetaji had asked the doctor in English\\nif he would stay with him the whole night.\\nBut at around 7 in the evening, he suffered a relapse\\nand the doctor gives him another camphor injection.\\nBut despite that, he passed away shortly after.\\nFriends, if you want to know \\nabout Indian history and world history in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks on Kuku FM.\\nLike this one on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nOr this one on Stalin.\\nThere are many audiobooks on Indian freedom fighters too.\\nLike this one on Mahatma Gandhi.\\nKuku FM is a great platform for audio learning.\\nBecause you get to listen to numerous audiobooks here.\\nOn almost every topic.\\nWhether you want to study history, \\ngeography, politics, religion or fiction.\\nEverything will be in audio form.\\nIf you haven\\'t joined Kuku FM yet,\\nyou can find a special 50% off \\ncoupon code in the description.\\nYou can check it out.\\nNow let\\'s get back to the topic.\\nFor this mystery, the second major inquiry\\nwas conducted in 1956.\\nThis was the first inquiry by the Indian government.\\nThe Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThis committee was led by Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nthe same INA officer who was put on trial in Red Fort.\\nBut there were two other notable members on this committee,\\nS N Maitra, a civil servant of the West Bengal government,\\nand Suresh Chandra Bose, Netaji\\'s elder brother.\\nBetween April and July 1956,\\nthis committee interviewed 67 witnesses.\\nIn India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam,\\npeople who met Netaji before the crash.\\nAnd those who survived the crash.\\nThere were 7 survivors of this plane crash.\\nAnd this committee interviewed 5 of them in person\\nAlong with that, an additional doctor,\\nDr. Yoshimi, who was a surgeon in that hospital\\nwho treated Netaji in his final hours,\\nwas also interviewed.\\nThis inquiry resulted in a 3-page draft report.\\nWhich had three major points.\\nFirst, on 18th August, a plane \\ncrashed in Taihoku where Netaji d!ed.\\nSecond, he was cremated there.\\nAnd third, his ashes\\nwere taken to the Renkoji temple in Tokyo\\nand placed there.\\nBut the strange thing here was that\\none of the three people on this committee,\\nNetaji\\'s elder brother, Suresh Chandra Bose,\\nrefused to sign the final report.\\nHe wrote a note in which he blamed Shahnawaz and Nehru\\nfor withholding crucial evidence.\\nAccording to him, the committee\\'s aim was to prove\\nthat Netaji d!ed in this plane crash.\\nAnd the final report of 181 pages,\\nif two or more stories narrated by witnesses\\ndid not match other testimonies,\\nthen the entire testimony of the witness\\nshould be considered false.\\nBased on this, Suresh Chandra Bose said\\nthat there was no crash,\\nand that his brother was still alive\\nclaiming that the committee report was incorrect.\\nThe final report was still published with two-thirds consensus\\non 3rd August 1956\\nand the Indian Parliament accepted it in September 1956.\\nBut Suresh Chandra Bose did not give any alternate theory.\\nIn February 1966,\\n10 years after the publication of the report,\\nhe claimed that in the following month, March,\\nNetaji would reveal himself to the world.\\nOnce again, this claim spread among the masses.\\nCould Netaji really be alive?\\nMarch came and went but Netaji never returned.\\nMid-1960s was the time when\\nthe stories of Shaulmari Baba were becoming popular.\\nBecause of this, the government decided\\nthat another inquiry should be conducted.\\nIn 1970, a Khosla commission was set up\\nas the third major inquiry into the d3ath of Netaji.\\nThe Khosla Commission was a one-man commission,\\nonly one person was carrying out the investigation.\\nG.D. Khosla,\\nwho was the retired Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court.\\nHe submitted his report in 1974.\\nAnd his report reiterated the same things\\nstated by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThere was one major difference between the investigation he conducted\\nand that conducted by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nJustice Khosla actually went to Taiwan\\nto see the crash site.\\nBut he couldn\\'t find the crash site.\\nBecause the airport where the crash happened\\ndidn\\'t exist after 1970.\\nShah Nawaz Committee members had tried to go to Taiwan\\nbut at that time, India-Taiwan relations weren\\'t good.\\nSo it was not possible.\\nBut the Khosla Commission didn\\'t discover anything new.\\nJustice Khosla spoke to more than 224 witnesses.\\nFour co-passengers of Netaji who had survived this crash\\nand five eyewitnesses who had seen this crash,\\nwere interviewed.\\nBy this time, many conspiracy theories had already gained traction,\\nand Justice Khosla had written in his report \\n\"to what extent fantasy and perversion of truth can proceed.\"\\nThe stories and conspiracy theories that were being spread,\\nhad political goals.\\nOr were spread by people who simply wanted to seek attention.\\nHe was surprised to see the extent to which\\nfake news can be spread about this.\\nOur story would have ended here,\\nbut as I said, in the late 1980s,\\nstories of the Gumnami Baba started becoming popular.\\nSo in 1999, when the BJP government was formed,\\nthe government decided that\\nthere should be another investigation.\\nThe government appointed a retired Supreme Court judge,\\nManoj Kumar Mukherjee,\\nto investigate this case.\\nAnd this is how the Mukherjee Commission was formed.\\nMore than 100 files were investigated by this commission.\\nThey went to Japan, Russia, and Taiwan again.\\nDNA test was carried out to test the Gumnami Baba theory.\\nThe DNA test I mentioned earlier in this video.\\nBut this DNA test proved to be a failure.\\nBut the real purpose of this report\\nwas to prove somehow that\\nthe theory of the plane crash was wrong.\\nAnd to prove this theory wrong,\\nmany claims were raised in the Mukherjee report.\\nFirst, it is stated that Habibur Rahman said\\nthat this plane took a nose dive from 12,000 feet and crashed.\\nThis report question that\\nin such a case, no one would be able to survive.\\nSo this theory had to be false.\\nBut where did this 12,000 feet figure come from?\\nNo one knows.\\nBecause Habibur Rehman never said that.\\nAnd by the time this Mukherjee Commission was formed,\\nHabibur Rehman had already passed away due to natural causes.\\nThe Mukherjee Commission concluded that\\nthis flight did take off from Saigon\\nbut it didn\\'t crash.\\nHe said that Netaji would still be alive\\nbecause there were no records or documents in any hospital or crematorium\\nrelated to his d3ath.\\nIt is worth noting that\\nby this point in time, 55 years had already passed\\nsince the plane crash.\\nEven after all this,\\nthe Mukherjee Commission did not present any alternate theory.\\nIt did not state\\nwhat could have happened \\nother than the plane crash.\\nThird, this report stated that\\nthe Japanese temple where Netaji\\'s ashes \\nwere said to have been placed,\\nwas not actually Netaji\\'s ashes\\nbut the ashes of a Japanese soldier.\\nBut when the chief priest of that temple said\\nthat they could do a DNA test,\\nJustice Mukherjee did not get the test done.\\nAnother false claim raised in Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was that\\nwhy was nothing published in any newspaper about Netaji\\'s d3ath\\nwhen the plane crashed.\\nThis was the argument in this report.\\nBut, actually, there were two local Taiwanese newspapers\\nthat published this news.\\nTaiwan Didi Shimpao and \\nTaiwan Nichi Nichi Shimbun.\\nIn both these newspapers, not only was the plane crash reported\\nbut they also mentioned Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nOn top of that, historian Leonard A. Gordon,\\nwho was the biographer for Bose,\\nsaid that his books were mentioned as resources in this report\\nbut they were misinterpreted. \\nThe names of the books were mistitled or mislisted.\\nFinally, the Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was published 6 years later,\\non 8th November 2005.\\nAnd in May 2006,\\nwhen this report was submitted to the Indian Parliament,\\nthe Parliament rejected this report.\\nThe reason for the rejection was obvious,\\nthe things I just told you about,\\nbut by this time, Congress\\' UPA government had come into power.\\nThe rumours of conspiracy\\nwere going to continue.\\nBecause people were saying,\\nthose who were propagating this conspiracy theory,\\nthat since the Congress government was back in power,\\nthis report was going to be rejected anyway.\\nBut even if you believe the Mukherjee Commission Report,\\nand claim that the theory of the plane crash is wrong,\\nthe second problem is that\\nthere was no alternate explanation.\\nIf the plane crash didn\\'t happen, \\nwhat did happen?\\nThe Mukherjee Commission said nothing regarding it.\\nPeople\\'s next hope were the classified files.\\nThere are many old files\\nwhich have been classified by the Indian government\\nand not presented to the public.\\nSo, there must be some truth hidden in these files.\\nBy 2016, the Modi government had come into power,\\n304 files were declassified by the government.\\nThis was announced in the Parliament\\non 2nd March 2016.\\nThese were the last files which \\nwere not presented to the public.\\nMany files were declassified by previous governments as well.\\nFor example, the first HD Deve Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified 990 files in 1997.\\nAfter that, Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\ndeclassified around 1,000 files in 2012.\\nWhy were these files declassified at three different times?\\nThe reason was that Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified mostly Ministry of Defense\\'s files.\\nDr Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\nmostly declassified the files of the Home and Defense Ministry.\\nIn 2016, Modi\\'s government\\ndeclassified the files from the PMO, \\nMinistry of External Affairs and Cabinet Secretary.\\nIn the last declassification of the files,\\none file was regarding the Indian Independence League.\\nThe Indian Independence League had \\nconducted an independent investigation\\ninto the d3ath of Netaji.\\nIn 1953, a report was submitted on this.\\nA shocking thing was revealed in this report.\\nThis report states that\\nthe plane crash theory was true.\\nBut it is also states that\\nthis plane crash was carried out\\nby a faction of the Japanese government.\\nIn the beginning of the video, I told you\\nhow Netaji went from Bangkok to Saigon,\\nwith 6 INA associates.\\nBut in Saigon he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people on the plane.\\nAccording to this report, this was a calculated plan.\\nSome people in the Japanese government\\nwanted to have this plane be crashed.\\nThe year when the Modi government declassified these files,\\nthe government asked other countries\\nto declassify their files too,\\nthat related to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nSo in response, Austria, Germany, \\nRussia, the UK, and the USA,\\nplaced all their files related to Netaji in public domain.\\nThey declassified their files.\\nBut, and this is an important but,\\nJapan was the only country that \\ndidn\\'t declassify all their secret files.\\nJapan had 5 secret files.\\nThey did declassify 2 of them\\nthat mention the same things.\\nA plane crash and the same descriptions.\\nBut to date, Japan still has 3 such classified files.\\nJapan has not released them to the public.\\nDoes this mean that\\nthis plane crash was really \\norchestrated by some Japanese people?\\nWithout any further evidence,\\nI don\\'t want to draw any conclusions here.\\nWe can know this for certain\\nonly when we get more evidence supporting it.\\nBut I will say that things look suspicious\\nbecause these 3 files have not been declassified.\\nBut whether this is true or not,\\none thing is for certain.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s d3ath\\nhappened that day, in that plane crash.\\nWe can say this for sure.\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nChandra Kumar Bose, who was \\na BJP member till September 2023,\\nsaid that his family regrets that\\nthey believed in these conspiracy theories for years.\\nThis is a bitter truth that they had to accept.\\nThe truth that Netaji\\nd!ed in that air crash.\\nHe also said that the rumours and \\nconspiracy theories that are spread\\nare an insult to Netaji.\\nWe should reject all these conspiracy theories\\nand ignore the people who spread such rumours.\\nWe cannot say with 100% accuracy\\nwhy the plane crash happened.\\nBut we do know that between 1945 and 1974,\\n10 different investigations took place to uncover the truth.\\nBy the British Army, \\nby the Japan Allied Command,\\nby the British India Government, \\nby the Japanese Government,\\nby the Taiwanese Government,\\nby the Independent India\\'s Government.\\nIn addition to these, many individual journalists\\ncarried out independent investigations.\\nAll investigations reached the same conclusion.\\nThe same points that were mentioned \\nin the Shah Nawaz Commission Report.\\nNetaji\\'s only daughter, Anita Bose, believes this too.\\n\"And I think the declassification of files\\ncertainly also made available \\nthe documentation which prove that\\nhe d!ed, in fact, on August 18th, 1945\\nin an air crash,\\nor as a consequence of an air crash,\\nin what is now Taiwan.\"\\nIf Netaji\\'s family does not believe in these conspiracy theories\\nand considers them disrespectful,\\nthen the least we can do is\\nto stop spreading these rumours.\\nIf we want to honour Netaji\\'s legacy,\\nwe should learn from his values.\\nWe should take inspiration from his story,\\ninstead of spreading these conspiracies.\\nIf you found this video informative,\\nyou can click here to watch part 1 of this video,\\nwhere I tell you about Netaji\\'s story.\\nAnd I\\'ll see you in the next video.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None,

text='Hello, friends!\\n16th August, 1945.\\nWorld War II was on the verge of ending.\\nJapan had laid down their weapons and surrendered.\\nAnd in Germany, Hitler took his own life.\\nGermany and Japan, both countries\\nhad lost this war terribly.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose,\\nwho was taking Japan\\'s help to \\nlead the Indian National Army since 1943,\\nwas looking for new ways\\nto continue the freedom struggle.\\nEven though the plans weren\\'t properly laid out,\\nhis associates knew that\\nNetaji wanted to shift his base into the Soviet Union.\\nHis plan was to first go to Tokyo\\nto thank the Japanese Government\\nand leave for Soviet from there.\\nThe reason for this was very simple.\\nThe Soviet Union was a part of the Allied Forces.\\nThe countries that won this war.\\nBut despite this, the Soviet was\\nideologically different from other \\nallied countries like the US and the UK.\\nDue to his Communist ideology, Netaji hoped\\nthat they would help India \\nin our fight against the British.\\nBut the problem was that \\nJapan\\'s loss was still fresh.\\nAnd there had been two nuclear \\nattacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nSo there weren\\'t many options for Netaji to travel to Tokyo.\\nThe Japanese forces found a way for him to travel\\nthat looked like this.\\nHe would board a Mitsubishi \\nKi-21 Heavy Bomber aircraft,\\nthat would take off from Saigon in Vietnam.\\nThis aircraft would make a stop in Taiwan\\'s Heito,\\nfrom there, it would fly to Taihoku Prefecture\\npresent-day Taipei in Taiwan.\\nAnd then one last stop in China\\'s Manchuria territory,\\nbefore finally reaching the final destination, Tokyo.\\nBack in those days, Manchuria was\\na puppet state of Japan, known as Manchukuo.\\nBut from 9th August,\\nthe Soviet Union started invading this place.\\nNetaji knew this,\\nso he thought that\\nhe should establish his first contact \\nwith the Soviets in Manchukuo.\\nFollowing this itinerary,\\nNetaji left Bangkok on the morning of 17th August\\nwith his INA group.\\nAnd reached Saigon, Vietnam around 10 AM.\\nUpon reaching here, he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people to sit \\nin the heavy bomber aircraft.\\nSo, it wasn\\'t possible for Netaji to go ahead \\nwith all his Indian National Army companions.\\nHe had to choose only one person.\\nHe chose to go on this journey with \\nhis companion Habibur Rahman.\\nOn 17th August around 5 PM,\\nthis plane took off from Saigon\\ncarrying about 12-13 people.\\nApart from Netaji and Colonel Habibur Rahman,\\nthe remaining passengers were either from \\nthe Japanese military or Japanese crew members.\\nBecause it was going to be dark soon,\\nthis plane made an unscheduled stop at Tourane,\\nwhich is the present-day Da Nang city.\\nThe passengers stayed the night at a hotel\\nand the crew worked on making this plane lighter.\\nMany weapons, ammunition, and machine guns\\nwere taken off the plane\\nso that it could be made lighter for the long journey.\\nNext morning on 18th August,\\nthe plane took off early at 5 AM.\\nAnd since the plane was lighter by then,\\nthe pilot skipped the next scheduled stop, Heito.\\nNext stop was Taihoku, the city of Taipei,\\nwhere the plane landed around 12 noon.\\nThe passengers had their lunch during the 2 hours stop\\nand the plane was refuelled.\\nDuring the plane\\'s testing,\\nthe pilot and the engineer saw that\\nthere was something wrong \\nwith the left engine of the plane.\\nThey didn\\'t investigate further,\\nthey thought it must be fine\\nsince the engine was fairly new.\\nOn 18th August, at 2 PM,\\nthe plane took off again.\\nJust a few minutes after the plane took off,\\na loud bang was heard.\\nAs if the plane\\'s engine had exploded.\\nThe plane started to go out of control\\nand it eventually crashed within a few seconds.\\nThe people in and near the cockpit,\\nthe pilot, co-pilot and a Japanese general,\\nd!ed immediately.\\nBehind the general, near the left wing,\\nnext to the plane\\'s petrol tank,\\nwas Netaji.\\nAnd behind him was Habibur Rahman.\\nSince both of them were towards the back of the plane,\\nmiraculously, after the crash,\\nthey came out of the plane alive.\\nBut Netaji was in a very bad condition, \\nbeing drenched in gasoline.\\nThe back door of the plane was not opening,\\nso they had to exit from the front entrance.\\nDoing this meant that\\nthey had to pass through the flames.\\nAnd since Netaji was completely drenched in petrol,\\nhe got burnt instantly.\\nHabibur Rahman tried his best to save him.\\nHe used clothes to put out the fire.\\nWithin 15 minutes, he takes Netaji \\nto the nearby Nammon Military Hospital.\\nBut unfortunately,\\nhe was unsuccessful in saving Netaji\\'s life.\\nThe d3ath of Subhash Chandra Bose\\ntook place in this hospital a few hours later.\\nThis painful story of the plane crash\\nis still merely a story for some people.\\nSome people believe that\\nNetaji had actually reached the Soviet Union\\nand he was imprisoned there\\nand tortured for the rest of his life.\\nOn the other hand, some people believe\\nthat this plane crash was just a ruse.\\nNetaji was actually alive\\nand he had returned to India in a disguise.\\nHe became a hermit in Ayodhya\\nand spent the rest of his life as a hermit.\\nGumnami Baba.\\nWhat\\'s the truth?\\nWhy is Netaji\\'s d3ath such a big mystery?\\nWhat was found when this was investigated?\\nLet\\'s try to understand these\\nin this video.\\nThis video is the second part\\non Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s story.\\nIf you haven\\'t seen the first video,\\nyou can find the link in the description below.\\nNow, before talking about which \\nconspiracy theory is true and which is not,\\nlet\\'s take a look at the pages of history.\\nOn an incident that is always ignored,\\nwhile talking about Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nI am talking about INA trials,\\nwhich took place on Delhi\\'s Red Fort \\non 5th November 1945.\\nThis is about 2.5 months after Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nMost of the Indian National Army troops\\nwere captured by the British.\\nApproximately 25,000 INA soldiers\\nwere in British custody.\\nOut of the 25,000, 3 soldiers\\nfaced a public case in Red Fort this day.\\n\"The British government decided that\\nin the eyes of the world,\\nto prove the Indian National Army a criminal group,\\nthere had to be an open trial in the Red Fort.\"\\nThese three soldiers were very special.\\nCaptain Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nLieutenant Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon,\\nand Captain Prem Kumar Sahgal.\\nDuring Netaji\\'s struggle over the last few years,\\nthe British Empire had cleverly\\nsuppressed all the news about the INA.\\nThis meant that most Indians did not know\\nthe extent of Netaji\\'s contributions.\\nBut when the INA troops were captured by the British,\\nthe British government decided to\\nportray these trials in a highly-publicised manner to the public.\\nThe news of the trials against these \\n3 soldiers\\' spread across the country.\\nThe British government believed that\\nsince Netaji\\'s INA had attacked the British government,\\npeople would see it as an attack against the country,\\npeople would treat the INA as traitors.\\nThey believed that the public support will be with the British\\nbecause the British government\\ntried to portray the British government as the country.\\nBut this plan backfired completely.\\nThe result was just the opposite.\\nMost people saw that\\nthe people who are labelled as traitors by the government\\nwere actually the biggest patriots.\\nThousands of people were out on the streets to protest.\\nThe common masses made their voices heard.\\nThey claimed that these soldiers should not be punished.\\nThe crowd of protesters soon reached the Red Fort.\\nInterestingly, these three officers\\nbelonged to three religions.\\nSahgal was a Hindu,\\nKhan was a Muslim,\\nand Dhillon was a Sikh.\\nIndia\\'s three major religious communities.\\nThe same religious harmony\\nthat was seen in Netaji Subhash \\nChandra Bose\\'s Indian National Army.\\nNow, it was there in front of the country in the Red Fort.\\nThese three soldiers became \\na symbol of religious and national unity.\\nA case was filed against these three\\nfor waging war against the nation\\nunder Section 121 of IPC.\\nAlong with charges of m*rder and abetment to m*rder.\\nBut seeing this attempt to label \\nthe freedom fighters as traitors,\\npeople were even more infuriated.\\nKolkata, the city where Netaji \\nhad spent many years of his life,\\nsaw the most violent protests.\\nOn 23rd November, in a police firing,\\naround 100 protesters were killed.\\nWhat was the Congress Party doing during this?\\nCongress established an INA defence committee.\\n\"On the advice of Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nthe Indian National Congress\\nhas established a high-level defence committee.\"\\nThey decided to legally defend \\nthese three soldiers in the court.\\nThe defence committee that was formed\\nincluded Tej Bahadur Sapru,\\nBhulabhai Desai,\\nAsaf Ali, and Jawaharlal Nehru himself.\\nYou heard it right, Jawaharlal Nehru,\\nwho used to be a lawyer,\\nhad not worn the lawyer\\'s gown for many years.\\nBut at that point,\\nhe presented himself in the court as a lawyer.\\nThey argued in the British court that\\nthe provisional government created by Netaji\\nand the Indian National Army,\\nwas not illegal under international law.\\nBecause a state called Azad Hind \\n[Independent India] was created,\\nand its army had waged the war.\\nThey argued that the British \\ngovernment\\'s internal laws and regulations\\ncould not be imposed on Azad Hind and the INA.\\nObviously, since the British government \\nwas fighting in a British court,\\nthis legal fight was not successful.\\nOn 3rd January 1946,\\nwhen the court\\'s verdict was announced,\\nKhan, Sahgal, and Dhillon were \\nsentenced to transportation for life.\\nBasically, they are sent to exile\\nfrom where they would never return.\\nBut no court or government can withstand \\nthe power of the people.\\nThe people were so angry,\\nand the protests were relentless,\\nthat under public pressure, the government had to\\nrelease these soldiers.\\nThe British government was shocked to see\\nthat the soldiers of the British Indian Army\\nwere also revolting.\\nThose soldiers refused to fight,\\non behalf of the British.\\nThis later led to the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny.\\nThat is a story in itself,\\nwe can talk about that in another video.\\nBut because of these INA trials,\\nNetaji\\'s story had spread all over the country.\\nThe story of a man\\nwho had achieved such amazing feats in his life.\\nHow he could disguise himself repeatedly\\nto fool multiple countries.\\nHe went from one country to another to form an army.\\nSometimes in a submarine,\\nsometimes in an aeroplane.\\nThis story was no less than a superhero\\'s tale.\\nFor this reason, some people and \\nsome INA soldiers started doubting that\\nif Netaji had indeed d!ed in a plane crash.\\nThis didn\\'t seem probable.\\nHe had changed his disguises so many times,\\nfooled so many people,\\npeople started believing that \\nhe must be faking his d3ath too.\\nMaybe he used a body double in the plane crash.\\nBecause Allied Powers had already won World War II\\nand he did this to save himself from being captured.\\nOn top of that, there was no death certificate\\nnor any photo of the dead body.\\nThey had Habibur Rahman\\'s account only.\\nSo, it was understandable for people to have doubts.\\nEven when Mahatma Gandhi heard this news,\\nof Netaji\\'s plane having crashed,\\nhe too refused to believe that\\nNetaji could have died.\\nOnly after talking to Habibur Rahman personally,\\ndid Gandhi change his stance.\\nBut this doubt remained with many people in the country\\nand they kept waiting for the day\\nwhen Netaji would come back\\nand reveal himself to the public.\\nSome of them were Netaji\\'s associates.\\nAn organisation called Subhash Wadi Janta Party was formed\\nby some of these associates,\\nwho refuse to believe the plane crash theory.\\nAccording to their chronology, Netaji had come to India\\nand had become a hermit.\\nThey claim that he attended \\nGandhi ji\\'s cremation in 1948,\\nin disguise.\\nAnd then, from 1956 to 1959,\\nhe lived in a Shiva temple in Bareilly as a hermit.\\nThere, he is said to have become an expert in herbs\\nand even discovered the cure for tuberculosis.\\nIn 1959, Netahi is said to have\\nopened an ashram in Jalpaiguri city, Bengal.\\nShaulmari Ashram.\\nCalling himself Shreemad Saranandji.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nis called the Shaulmari Baba Theory.\\nThis ashram actually existed\\nand this Baba was also real.\\nIn the 1960s, this conspiracy theory spread so much that\\nShaulmari Baba had to clarify that\\nhe was not Netaji.\\nBut his followers still kept insisting,\\nthat he was Netaji \\neven though he claimed not to be.\\nAnother conspiracy theory that\\nwas developed by some other associates of Netaji\\nwas that the plane had actually landed\\nand he had reached the Soviet Union as planned.\\nBut in the Soviet, Netaji was captured by Russians\\nand then t0rtured in concentration camps.\\nThe Russians used this\\nas a leverage against Prime Minister Nehru.\\nIn fact, not only Nehru\\nbut even Prime Minister Indira Gandhi\\nwas threatened with this.\\nRussians said that if India did not side with the Soviet Union,\\nthey would release Netaji from jail\\nand let the whole world know.\\nThis conspiracy theory\\nwas based on the misconception that\\nNetaji was a threat to Prime Minister Nehru\\nand opposed Congress.\\nAnd that if he were to return to India,\\nhe would have been the PM instead of Nehru.\\nThere is no rhyme nor reason \\nfor this conspiracy theory because\\nas I said in the previous video,\\nNetaji actually admired Nehru a lot.\\nThis is why he named on of the Azad Hind Brigade\\nafter Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nAnd the same mutual admiration\\nwas extended by Jawaharlal Nehru towards Netaji.\\nAfter his d3ath, he was called a national hero.\\nThere are some other interesting theories,\\nlike Netaji going to China,\\nand leading some operations there.\\nWe won\\'t talk about all that.\\nLet\\'s discuss the most popular theory about him.\\nThis is the theory of the Gumnami Baba.\\nHarvard professor Sugata Bose,\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nin his book His Majesty\\'s Opponent \\npublished in 2011,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose \\nand India\\'s Struggle Against Empire,\\nmentioned that in 2002,\\nthe judiciary asked him to donate 1 ml blood\\nso that his DNA could be compared to a Gumnami Baba\\'s.\\nThis was because some people were claiming\\nthat a Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThis was in 2002.\\n57 years since Netaji passed away.\\nHis family was shocked to know that\\neven government institutions were \\npromoting such a bizarre theory.\\nBut still, he donated his blood.\\nOf course, the evidence was negative.\\nThe DNA did not match.\\nBut still, the Gumnami Baba theory still remains popular.\\nThere are some people on social media\\nwho have taken up this theory again\\nand spread conspiracies repeatedly just for views.\\nThe theory of Gumnami Baba actually started in Russia.\\nThat under Stalin\\'s government\\nhe used to carry out top-secret covert operations.\\nLike a one-man army.\\nIn the Korean war of 1952,\\nhe is said to have led the Asian Liberation Army.\\nAfter that, in the war of 1962,\\nhe is said to have led the Chinese army against India\\nbecause he wanted to remove all western influence from India.\\nAnd since Indians didn\\'t recognise Gumnami Baba,\\nhe asked the army to retreat.\\nThe story doesn\\'t end here.\\nAfter this, in 1969, Gumnami Baba\\nfought against the USA in Vietnam.\\nIn 1971, he played a major role \\nin liberating Bangladesh.\\nHe was also guiding Mukti Vahini.\\nAnd finally, after everything,\\nhe became a hermit in India.\\nSpecifically, a hermit living in Ayodhya.\\nWho passed away on 16th September 1985.\\nThere was no photo of this Gumnami Baba\\'s d3ath,\\nnor was there any official d3ath certificate.\\nBut 44 days after his d3ath,\\na local newspaper published the news.\\nThe newspaper published that\\nthe Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nThe newspaper was called Naye Log [New People].\\nSenior journalist Sheetla Singh,\\nwho was working with another local newspaper at that time,\\nnamed Jan Morcha,\\ninvestigated this story in November 1985.\\nFor his investigation,\\nhe went to Kolkata to meet a close friend of Netaji,\\nPabitra Mohan Roy,\\nformer Intelligence Officer of INA.\\nHe said that throughout the years\\nhe met a new hermit, or a new mysterious person\\nin his search of Netaji.\\nIn this attempt, he went from Kohima to Punjab,\\nfrom Faizabad to Ayodhya.\\nBut none of the Babas were Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nHere you might get confused\\nI talked about a few Babas earlier\\nso why was this person meeting different Babas every year.\\nActually, friends, this Baba angle\\nhas multiple versions.\\nMany claims by different people.\\nSomeone in Karnataka may claim that a certain Babas was Netaji,\\nsomeone may claim that in UP,\\nand someone in MP.\\nWhen this news was published in Jan Morcha\\nabout Gumnami Baba theory,\\na fight broke out in the media.\\nMany local newspapers in Uttar Pradesh,\\nstarted talking about\\nhow Gumnami Baba was like.\\nEveryone started claiming that he was Netaji.\\nSome people started saying that\\nthey had known for years \\nthat Gumnami Baba was Netaji.\\nBut because he had taken an oath\\nthat they could not tell anyone about this,\\nso they had to remain silent.\\nQuite ironic because actually\\nhad they actually taken an oath\\nthat they would not tell this to anyone\\nwhy would they talk about it now?\\nIf you think logically about this theory,\\nit doesn\\'t make any sense.\\nWhat would be Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s motivation\\nto hide his identity?\\nIf he really was Gumnami Baba,\\nthen why would he be in a disguise\\nand spend the rest of his life as a hermit?\\nSome people on social media claim that\\nthis was done to protect India\\'s geopolitical interests.\\nHad Netaji come in front of the public,\\nit wouldn\\'t have been good for India.\\nI don\\'t understand their strange logic.\\nI think some people spread such \\nconspiracy theories for attention and views.\\nAnother argument in favour of the Gumnami Baba Theory is that\\nthis Baba used to speak English fluently.\\nHe used to discuss geopolitical issues with great confidence.\\nThat\\'s why he could be none other than Netaji.\\nBut today, look around you.\\nThere are so many Babas\\nwho talk in English with great confidence.\\nHave discussions on geopolitical issues.\\nWould you ever say that they are not a Baba,\\nbut Albert Einstein in disguise?\\nI don\\'t want to counter these theories with jokes.\\nI want to show you the truth with proof.\\nBecause in the last 70 years,\\nmultiple investigations have been carried out on this.\\nA lot of inquiries have been conducted\\nand many reports have been published.\\nLet\\'s understand these reports one-by-one\\nand try to find out the truth.\\nThe first was the Figgess Report of 1946.\\nThis was an investigation by the British.\\nUnder Lord Mountbatten,\\nintelligence officer Colonel John Figgess\\nwas tasked with investigating the \\nd3ath of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nFiggess submitted his report on 25th July 1946.\\nThis report remained confidential for many decades.\\nBut today, it is publicly available.\\nThis report confirms four things.\\nFirst, a plane crashed on 18th August 1945\\nnear Taihoku airport.\\nSecond, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was in the plane.\\nThird, Netaji d!ed in a nearby \\nmilitary hospital on the same day.\\nFourth, he was cremated in Taihoku\\nand his ashes were later sent to Tokyo.\\nThe most important testimony in this report\\nwas of a Japanese doctor, \\nToyoshi Tsuruta,\\nwho was working in Nammon Hospital that day.\\nThe hospital where Netaji was taken after the crash.\\nIt is written in this report that\\nNetaji had asked the doctor in English\\nif he would stay with him the whole night.\\nBut at around 7 in the evening, he suffered a relapse\\nand the doctor gives him another camphor injection.\\nBut despite that, he passed away shortly after.\\nFriends, if you want to know \\nabout Indian history and world history in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks on Kuku FM.\\nLike this one on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\\nOr this one on Stalin.\\nThere are many audiobooks on Indian freedom fighters too.\\nLike this one on Mahatma Gandhi.\\nKuku FM is a great platform for audio learning.\\nBecause you get to listen to numerous audiobooks here.\\nOn almost every topic.\\nWhether you want to study history, \\ngeography, politics, religion or fiction.\\nEverything will be in audio form.\\nIf you haven\\'t joined Kuku FM yet,\\nyou can find a special 50% off \\ncoupon code in the description.\\nYou can check it out.\\nNow let\\'s get back to the topic.\\nFor this mystery, the second major inquiry\\nwas conducted in 1956.\\nThis was the first inquiry by the Indian government.\\nThe Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThis committee was led by Shah Nawaz Khan,\\nthe same INA officer who was put on trial in Red Fort.\\nBut there were two other notable members on this committee,\\nS N Maitra, a civil servant of the West Bengal government,\\nand Suresh Chandra Bose, Netaji\\'s elder brother.\\nBetween April and July 1956,\\nthis committee interviewed 67 witnesses.\\nIn India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam,\\npeople who met Netaji before the crash.\\nAnd those who survived the crash.\\nThere were 7 survivors of this plane crash.\\nAnd this committee interviewed 5 of them in person\\nAlong with that, an additional doctor,\\nDr. Yoshimi, who was a surgeon in that hospital\\nwho treated Netaji in his final hours,\\nwas also interviewed.\\nThis inquiry resulted in a 3-page draft report.\\nWhich had three major points.\\nFirst, on 18th August, a plane \\ncrashed in Taihoku where Netaji d!ed.\\nSecond, he was cremated there.\\nAnd third, his ashes\\nwere taken to the Renkoji temple in Tokyo\\nand placed there.\\nBut the strange thing here was that\\none of the three people on this committee,\\nNetaji\\'s elder brother, Suresh Chandra Bose,\\nrefused to sign the final report.\\nHe wrote a note in which he blamed Shahnawaz and Nehru\\nfor withholding crucial evidence.\\nAccording to him, the committee\\'s aim was to prove\\nthat Netaji d!ed in this plane crash.\\nAnd the final report of 181 pages,\\nif two or more stories narrated by witnesses\\ndid not match other testimonies,\\nthen the entire testimony of the witness\\nshould be considered false.\\nBased on this, Suresh Chandra Bose said\\nthat there was no crash,\\nand that his brother was still alive\\nclaiming that the committee report was incorrect.\\nThe final report was still published with two-thirds consensus\\non 3rd August 1956\\nand the Indian Parliament accepted it in September 1956.\\nBut Suresh Chandra Bose did not give any alternate theory.\\nIn February 1966,\\n10 years after the publication of the report,\\nhe claimed that in the following month, March,\\nNetaji would reveal himself to the world.\\nOnce again, this claim spread among the masses.\\nCould Netaji really be alive?\\nMarch came and went but Netaji never returned.\\nMid-1960s was the time when\\nthe stories of Shaulmari Baba were becoming popular.\\nBecause of this, the government decided\\nthat another inquiry should be conducted.\\nIn 1970, a Khosla commission was set up\\nas the third major inquiry into the d3ath of Netaji.\\nThe Khosla Commission was a one-man commission,\\nonly one person was carrying out the investigation.\\nG.D. Khosla,\\nwho was the retired Chief Justice of the Punjab High Court.\\nHe submitted his report in 1974.\\nAnd his report reiterated the same things\\nstated by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nThere was one major difference between the investigation he conducted\\nand that conducted by the Shah Nawaz Committee.\\nJustice Khosla actually went to Taiwan\\nto see the crash site.\\nBut he couldn\\'t find the crash site.\\nBecause the airport where the crash happened\\ndidn\\'t exist after 1970.\\nShah Nawaz Committee members had tried to go to Taiwan\\nbut at that time, India-Taiwan relations weren\\'t good.\\nSo it was not possible.\\nBut the Khosla Commission didn\\'t discover anything new.\\nJustice Khosla spoke to more than 224 witnesses.\\nFour co-passengers of Netaji who had survived this crash\\nand five eyewitnesses who had seen this crash,\\nwere interviewed.\\nBy this time, many conspiracy theories had already gained traction,\\nand Justice Khosla had written in his report \\n\"to what extent fantasy and perversion of truth can proceed.\"\\nThe stories and conspiracy theories that were being spread,\\nhad political goals.\\nOr were spread by people who simply wanted to seek attention.\\nHe was surprised to see the extent to which\\nfake news can be spread about this.\\nOur story would have ended here,\\nbut as I said, in the late 1980s,\\nstories of the Gumnami Baba started becoming popular.\\nSo in 1999, when the BJP government was formed,\\nthe government decided that\\nthere should be another investigation.\\nThe government appointed a retired Supreme Court judge,\\nManoj Kumar Mukherjee,\\nto investigate this case.\\nAnd this is how the Mukherjee Commission was formed.\\nMore than 100 files were investigated by this commission.\\nThey went to Japan, Russia, and Taiwan again.\\nDNA test was carried out to test the Gumnami Baba theory.\\nThe DNA test I mentioned earlier in this video.\\nBut this DNA test proved to be a failure.\\nBut the real purpose of this report\\nwas to prove somehow that\\nthe theory of the plane crash was wrong.\\nAnd to prove this theory wrong,\\nmany claims were raised in the Mukherjee report.\\nFirst, it is stated that Habibur Rahman said\\nthat this plane took a nose dive from 12,000 feet and crashed.\\nThis report question that\\nin such a case, no one would be able to survive.\\nSo this theory had to be false.\\nBut where did this 12,000 feet figure come from?\\nNo one knows.\\nBecause Habibur Rehman never said that.\\nAnd by the time this Mukherjee Commission was formed,\\nHabibur Rehman had already passed away due to natural causes.\\nThe Mukherjee Commission concluded that\\nthis flight did take off from Saigon\\nbut it didn\\'t crash.\\nHe said that Netaji would still be alive\\nbecause there were no records or documents in any hospital or crematorium\\nrelated to his d3ath.\\nIt is worth noting that\\nby this point in time, 55 years had already passed\\nsince the plane crash.\\nEven after all this,\\nthe Mukherjee Commission did not present any alternate theory.\\nIt did not state\\nwhat could have happened \\nother than the plane crash.\\nThird, this report stated that\\nthe Japanese temple where Netaji\\'s ashes \\nwere said to have been placed,\\nwas not actually Netaji\\'s ashes\\nbut the ashes of a Japanese soldier.\\nBut when the chief priest of that temple said\\nthat they could do a DNA test,\\nJustice Mukherjee did not get the test done.\\nAnother false claim raised in Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was that\\nwhy was nothing published in any newspaper about Netaji\\'s d3ath\\nwhen the plane crashed.\\nThis was the argument in this report.\\nBut, actually, there were two local Taiwanese newspapers\\nthat published this news.\\nTaiwan Didi Shimpao and \\nTaiwan Nichi Nichi Shimbun.\\nIn both these newspapers, not only was the plane crash reported\\nbut they also mentioned Netaji\\'s d3ath.\\nOn top of that, historian Leonard A. Gordon,\\nwho was the biographer for Bose,\\nsaid that his books were mentioned as resources in this report\\nbut they were misinterpreted. \\nThe names of the books were mistitled or mislisted.\\nFinally, the Mukherjee Commission\\'s report was published 6 years later,\\non 8th November 2005.\\nAnd in May 2006,\\nwhen this report was submitted to the Indian Parliament,\\nthe Parliament rejected this report.\\nThe reason for the rejection was obvious,\\nthe things I just told you about,\\nbut by this time, Congress\\' UPA government had come into power.\\nThe rumours of conspiracy\\nwere going to continue.\\nBecause people were saying,\\nthose who were propagating this conspiracy theory,\\nthat since the Congress government was back in power,\\nthis report was going to be rejected anyway.\\nBut even if you believe the Mukherjee Commission Report,\\nand claim that the theory of the plane crash is wrong,\\nthe second problem is that\\nthere was no alternate explanation.\\nIf the plane crash didn\\'t happen, \\nwhat did happen?\\nThe Mukherjee Commission said nothing regarding it.\\nPeople\\'s next hope were the classified files.\\nThere are many old files\\nwhich have been classified by the Indian government\\nand not presented to the public.\\nSo, there must be some truth hidden in these files.\\nBy 2016, the Modi government had come into power,\\n304 files were declassified by the government.\\nThis was announced in the Parliament\\non 2nd March 2016.\\nThese were the last files which \\nwere not presented to the public.\\nMany files were declassified by previous governments as well.\\nFor example, the first HD Deve Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified 990 files in 1997.\\nAfter that, Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\ndeclassified around 1,000 files in 2012.\\nWhy were these files declassified at three different times?\\nThe reason was that Gowda\\'s government\\ndeclassified mostly Ministry of Defense\\'s files.\\nDr Manmohan Singh\\'s government\\nmostly declassified the files of the Home and Defense Ministry.\\nIn 2016, Modi\\'s government\\ndeclassified the files from the PMO, \\nMinistry of External Affairs and Cabinet Secretary.\\nIn the last declassification of the files,\\none file was regarding the Indian Independence League.\\nThe Indian Independence League had \\nconducted an independent investigation\\ninto the d3ath of Netaji.\\nIn 1953, a report was submitted on this.\\nA shocking thing was revealed in this report.\\nThis report states that\\nthe plane crash theory was true.\\nBut it is also states that\\nthis plane crash was carried out\\nby a faction of the Japanese government.\\nIn the beginning of the video, I told you\\nhow Netaji went from Bangkok to Saigon,\\nwith 6 INA associates.\\nBut in Saigon he was told that\\nthere was space for only two people on the plane.\\nAccording to this report, this was a calculated plan.\\nSome people in the Japanese government\\nwanted to have this plane be crashed.\\nThe year when the Modi government declassified these files,\\nthe government asked other countries\\nto declassify their files too,\\nthat related to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nSo in response, Austria, Germany, \\nRussia, the UK, and the USA,\\nplaced all their files related to Netaji in public domain.\\nThey declassified their files.\\nBut, and this is an important but,\\nJapan was the only country that \\ndidn\\'t declassify all their secret files.\\nJapan had 5 secret files.\\nThey did declassify 2 of them\\nthat mention the same things.\\nA plane crash and the same descriptions.\\nBut to date, Japan still has 3 such classified files.\\nJapan has not released them to the public.\\nDoes this mean that\\nthis plane crash was really \\norchestrated by some Japanese people?\\nWithout any further evidence,\\nI don\\'t want to draw any conclusions here.\\nWe can know this for certain\\nonly when we get more evidence supporting it.\\nBut I will say that things look suspicious\\nbecause these 3 files have not been declassified.\\nBut whether this is true or not,\\none thing is for certain.\\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\'s d3ath\\nhappened that day, in that plane crash.\\nWe can say this for sure.\\nNetaji\\'s grand nephew,\\nChandra Kumar Bose, who was \\na BJP member till September 2023,\\nsaid that his family regrets that\\nthey believed in these conspiracy theories for years.\\nThis is a bitter truth that they had to accept.\\nThe truth that Netaji\\nd!ed in that air crash.\\nHe also said that the rumours and \\nconspiracy theories that are spread\\nare an insult to Netaji.\\nWe should reject all these conspiracy theories\\nand ignore the people who spread such rumours.\\nWe cannot say with 100% accuracy\\nwhy the plane crash happened.\\nBut we do know that between 1945 and 1974,\\n10 different investigations took place to uncover the truth.\\nBy the British Army, \\nby the Japan Allied Command,\\nby the British India Government, \\nby the Japanese Government,\\nby the Taiwanese Government,\\nby the Independent India\\'s Government.\\nIn addition to these, many individual journalists\\ncarried out independent investigations.\\nAll investigations reached the same conclusion.\\nThe same points that were mentioned \\nin the Shah Nawaz Commission Report.\\nNetaji\\'s only daughter, Anita Bose, believes this too.\\n\"And I think the declassification of files\\ncertainly also made available \\nthe documentation which prove that\\nhe d!ed, in fact, on August 18th, 1945\\nin an air crash,\\nor as a consequence of an air crash,\\nin what is now Taiwan.\"\\nIf Netaji\\'s family does not believe in these conspiracy theories\\nand considers them disrespectful,\\nthen the least we can do is\\nto stop spreading these rumours.\\nIf we want to honour Netaji\\'s legacy,\\nwe should learn from his values.\\nWe should take inspiration from his story,\\ninstead of spreading these conspiracies.\\nIf you found this video informative,\\nyou can click here to watch part 1 of this video,\\nwhere I tell you about Netaji\\'s story.\\nAnd I\\'ll see you in the next video.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None,

\\nfrom the city of Kiel, Germany.\\nAlthough it carried the Nazi soldiers in it,\\nan Indian was also present among them.\\nAn Indian whose name was Matsuda.\\nThis submarine was tasked with \\nthe mission to travel Southward,\\nto go around Africa\\nand transfer Mr. Matsuda to a Japanese submarine.\\nIt sounds easy,\\nbut it was not without danger\\nThe sea route was full of British ships.\\nAnd this was during the World War II\\nwhen Germany and Japan \\nwere fighting against the British.\\nOn 26th April 1943,\\nafter a journey of about two and a half months,\\nwhen this German submarine \\nreached the coast of Madagascar,\\na Japanese submarine was spotted in front of it.\\nBut the sea was so stormy that\\nit could have been dangerous for \\nthese two submarines to get closer.\\nSo for the next two days, these submarines\\nkept moving in parallel.\\nFinally, when the weather cleared,\\nMr. Matsuda emerged from the submarine.\\nOn a small raft, paddling and drenched,\\nhe reached the Japanese submarine,\\nwhere he was welcomed by Captain Masao Teraoka.\\nYou may be wondering\\nwhy these German and Japanese submarines\\nwere helping an Indian during World War II.\\nThis is because, Mr. Matsuda is none other than\\nour Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nUnknowingly perhaps, \\nduring this historic journey,\\nhe became the first Indian\\nto travel in a submarine.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose is one \\nof the greatest freedom fighters of India\\nand his story is full of such amazing stories.\\nHow he escaped under the nose of the British government\\nwent to Germany, met Hitler,\\nwent to Russia and Japan,\\nmet the Japanese Prime Minister,\\nwent to Singapore, formed his own army.\\nAnd even while staying outside India,\\nhe launched the biggest war on \\nthe British government occupying India. \\nLet\\'s understand his story in this video.\\nLet\\'s start our story with 1939,\\nthe year when World War II started.\\nViceroy Lord Linlithgow\\ndeclared war on behalf of India\\nwithout consulting any Indian.\\nThis was an embarrassing situation for Congress.\\nAnd under the Government of India Act,\\nCongress had some control over the ministries\\nand so they resigned from their positions.\\nMeanwhile, Subhash Chandra Bose \\nwas organizing his own party,\\nThe Forward Bloc.\\nAlthough this party was formed from within the Congress,\\nbut by the year 1940,\\nit was separated from the Congress\\'s main organization.\\nThere were two reasons behind this.\\nFirst, Subhash Chandra Bose was \\nbecoming too vocal about his leftist ideology,\\nwhich wasn\\'t appreciated by the other leaders of Congress.\\nI have talked about this in detail \\nin the video on Gandhi versus Bose.\\nThe link is in the description \\nin case you haven\\'t watched it yet.\\nAnd the second reason was that Bose wanted\\nto use World War II for India\\'s benefit.\\nHe wanted to take action quickly\\nand breaking off from Congress \\nhad become a necessity for him.\\nIn July 1940,\\nBose was leading a march in Calcutta\\nbecause of which he was arrested by the British government.\\nBeing in jail, he challenged the government\\nby launching a hunger strike.\\n\"Release me, or I shall refuse to live.\"\\nHe made a straightforward announcement.\\n\"In 1940, he was languishing in prison.\\nSo he gave an ultimatum to the British government\\nand undertook a fast unto d3ath.\"\\nGradually, his health deteriorated.\\nAnd in just one week, the government decided\\nto release him from jail\\nand put him under house arrest.\\nThe government did not want to be blamed\\nif Subhash Chandra Bose were to d!e in jail.\\nSo they thought that as long as he was in poor health,\\nhe should be under house arrest.\\nAnd as soon as his health improved,\\nthey wanted to throw him back in jail.\\nBut Netaji was devising his own plans.\\nHis plan was to go to Germany\\nand ask the Germans for help\\nto fight against the British.\\nBut how could he reach Germany?\\nBose contacted a communist organization in Punjab\\nto find out if there was a way\\nto cross the border and reach Germany secretly.\\nHe was told that there was a way.\\nTo enter through Afghanistan,\\nand go to the Soviet Union,\\nfrom there he could go to Germany.\\nOn 16th January 1941,\\nat around 1.30 AM,\\nwhen the city was sleeping,\\nNetaji sneaked out of his house\\nwith his nephew, Shishir Kumar Bose.\\nHe was in disguise.\\nHe was pretending to be an insurance agent,\\nMuhammad Ziauddin.\\nTogether with Shishir, they drove through the dark all night\\nand reached Dhanbad at around 8.30 AM.\\nThey spend a night at Shishir\\'s brother Ashok\\'s house\\nand the next day, from the nearby Gomo station,\\nBose boarded the train Kalka Mail.\\nThis train reached Delhi first\\nand there, he took another train to go to Peshawar,\\nthe Frontier Mail.\\nIn Peshawar, he was received by\\nthe provincial leader of the Forward Bloc, \\nMian Akbar Shah.\\nThe next step was to leave the territory occupied by the British.\\nTo do this, he changed his disguise.\\nInstead of Mohammad Ziauddin,\\nhe became a deaf and mute Pathan man.\\nIt was necessary to be deaf and mute because\\nBose could not speak Pashto.\\nSo, if anyone came to check them at the border,\\nthe person accompanying him could tell them\\nthat he was a deaf and mute Pathan.\\nHe travelled with another leader of \\nthe Forward Bloc, Bhagat Ram Talwar,\\nand both pretended that they were going to \\nthe shrine of Adda Sharif in Afghanistan.\\nTo pray that they could speak and hear.\\nOn 26th January 1941,\\nthey left Peshawar\\nand crossed the border of the British Empire by evening.\\nBy the morning of 29th January,\\nthey had reached Adda Sharif\\nand completed the journey to Kabul in trucks and tanks.\\nIt took Netaji 15 days to reach Kabul from Calcutta.\\nBut the British government found out about his escape\\n12 days after the fact.\\nThis is because the people at his home,\\nconstantly delivered food to his room.\\nAnd his other nephews would simply eat his food.\\nPeople believed that Netaji was still in his room.\\nSince the food was delivered and eaten regularly.\\nHis escape was so secret that\\neven his mother didn\\'t know about it.\\nIt was only on 27th January\\nwhen a case was to be heard against \\nSubhash Chandra Bose in the court.\\nAnd when he did not appear at the court,\\nhis two nephews informed the police\\nthat he was not at home.\\nOn 27th January, the news of his \\ndisappearance was published in the newspaper,\\nin Anand Bazaar Patrika and Hindustan Herald.\\nAfter which Reuters picked up on it\\nand this news spread all over the world.\\nMany reports were made to the British intelligence.\\nOne report said that he was on a ship going to Japan,\\nanother said something else\\nbut none of the reports were correct.\\nA ship going to Japan from Calcutta \\nwas searched by the British.\\nBut there was no sign of Bose.\\nSubhash had told his nephew Shishir that\\nif the news of his escape could be a secret for 4-5 days,\\nit would be impossible to catch him after that.\\nAnd this was true because\\nafter that, the British government could not catch him again.\\nAfter reaching Kabul, Netaji went \\nto the Soviet embassy to ask for help.\\nBut he didn\\'t get any help from there\\nbecause the Russians mistook him to be a British agent\\nwho wanted to infiltrate the Soviet Union.\\nThen he tried to contact the German embassy.\\nHans Pilger, a German minister who was \\npresent at the embassy at that time,\\nsent a telegram to the German foreign minister\\non 5th February,\\nsaying that after meeting Subhash,\\nhe had advised him to\\nstay hidden in the market with his Indian friends\\nand on his behalf,\\nthe German minister would contact the Russian ambassador.\\nA few days later, Netaji received a message that\\nif he wanted to leave Afghanistan,\\nhe should meet the Italian ambassador.\\nThis meeting took place on 22nd February, 1941,\\nAnd on 10th March, Bose was asked to\\nget a new Italian passport.\\nBose was given a new Italian passport\\nwith a new Italian identity.\\nThis was the photo on his Italian passport\\nand his new name was Orlando Mazzotta.\\nIn the meantime, the British government had \\nintercepted an Italian diplomatic communication\\nand they had found out that\\nBose was in Kabul.\\nThey also found out that he was planning \\nto go to Germany through the Middle East.\\nTwo special operations executives of \\nBritish intelligence were tasked with\\nfinding Bose in Turkey and k!lling him before he reached Germany.\\nBut Netaji was one step ahead.\\nHe never went to the Middle East.\\nInstead, he went to Moscow using his new identity. \\nFrom Moscow, he finally boarded a train to Berlin,\\nand on 2nd April 1941,\\nhe reached the German capital, Berlin.\\nHere, Netaji had 3 objectives.\\nFirst, to set up an Indian government in exile.\\nSecond, to find a way for his voice to reach the people.\\nAnd third, to establish an army\\nmade up of Indians,\\nthose Indians who were prisoners of war.\\nNow let\\'s see one-by-one how Netaji worked on these\\nand how he met the German dictator, Hitler.\\nThe biggest struggle was that Germany\\nhad to give a diplomatic recognition to India.\\nHe wanted Germany and the other Axis Powers\\nto officially declare India to be a free country.\\nAnd to make India\\'s independence on of their war aims.\\nBut Germany never gave such a declaration\\nbecause Hitler was not comfortable with this idea.\\nIn his infamous book Mein Kampf, \\nHitler stated his opinion about India.\\nHe wrote that he admired the British government\\nfor the way they have dominated and administered India.\\nAnd despite having German blood,\\nin spite of everything,\\nhe wrote that he wanted to see India under British rule.\\nNot only that, Hitler made fun of Indian freedom fighters\\nby calling them Asiatic jugglers.\\nIndia\\'s fight for freedom was a joke to Hitler.\\nBut still, Hitler wanted to use Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\\nagainst the British in WWII.\\nNetaji was fully aware that\\nhis relationship with the Nazi Germany\\nwas merely a transactional relationship.\\nBoth sides saw their benefit,\\nthat\\'s why the relationship existed.\\nOtherwise, it wouldn\\'t.\\nWith this, he started working.\\nHe made plans on how\\nIndia can collaborate with the Axis Powers.\\nHe established a Free India Center in Berlin.\\nAnd then he submitted a memorandum to Hitler,\\nasking Hitler to attack India with his army,\\nso that the British could be removed from there.\\nIt would be akin to attacking the heart of the British Empire.\\nHe tried to manipulate the situation\\nto incite Hitler into taking his army\\nand fighting the British in India.\\nBut that had no positive result.\\nThe main reason was that Hitler \\nwas not concerned about India\\'s freedom.\\nBut there was another German who was \\nactually quite interested in helping Bose.\\nAdam von Trot,\\nhead of the India section of the Foreign Office in Berlin.\\nWith his help, this Foreign Office\\nwas turned into a Special India Division.\\nA few months later, on 2nd November 1941,\\nBose established the Free India Centre there.\\nIn fact, on this very road, \\nthat building you see there,\\nused to be the office of the Free India Centre.\\nToday, that\\'s just a cafe.\\nThere is no sign of it being an office before.\\nOn the other side, there is the Spanish embassy.\\nIn the first meeting at this centre, \\n6 decisions were made.\\nFirst, the name of the struggle \\nwas to be Azad Hind or Free India.\\nSecond, in Europe, the name of this organisation would be\\nAzad Hind Centre.\\nThird, the national anthem of our country would be Jana Gana Mana.\\nFourth, the emblem of the movement\\nwould be in tricolour with a springing tiger.\\nFifth, Indians would greet each other \\nwith the slogan of Jai Hind.\\nAnd the sixth, Subhash Chandra Bose would be given the title\\nNetaji.\\nOn 20th May 1941,\\nNetaji submitted a detailed plan to the German government\\non how to work on propaganda against \\nBritish imperialism all over the world.\\nA part of this plan was Azad Hind Radio.\\nOn 19th February 1942,\\nNetaji decided to give up the identity of Orlando Mazotta.\\nHe dropped it\\nand revealed his real identity to the world.\\nHe broadcast his first message \\nto the world through Azad Hind Radio.\\nThis is Subhash Chandra Bose\\nspeaking to you over Azad Hind Radio.\\nAnd starting in February 1942,\\nit began to be broadcast to the Indian population too.\\nSubhash Chandra Bose\\'s first address \\nto his countrymen through this radio was\\nthat everyone would continue with the struggle.\\nAnd that the Axis powers would soon help them in their mission\\nand together, they would fight against British imperialism.\\n\"Brothers and sisters,\\nthe struggle for freedom that we have started,\\nwe need to continue it until\\nwe get complete independence.\"\\nApart from the radio, a monthly journal was started,\\ncalled Azad Hind,\\nwith copies being rolled out starting in March 1942.\\nWithin a few days,\\n5,000 copies were circulated in Germany.\\nBut there were problems working on the third motive.\\nThe army that Bose wanted to create\\nhe wanted it to be called the Indian National Army.\\nBut the Nazi government refused to \\nrecognise a new independent army.\\nThat\\'s why this military unit was named\\nIndian Legion.\\nBose met more than 10,000 \\nprisoners of war and talked to them.\\nHe couldn\\'t convince everyone.\\nBut about half of the people were convinced to join his army.\\nSo, the strength of the Indian Legion \\nwas about 5,000 people.\\nEven though this army was small \\nin many ways, it was historic.\\nBecause Netaji had successfully brought people \\ntogether despite their castes and religious beliefs.\\nCaptain Walter Harbich,\\nthe one in charge of the training camp at that time,\\nnoted that\\n\"His Excellency, Netaji\\'s goal was to\\nparalyse the century-old antagonisms\\nrooted in the Indian nationalities,\\nreligions and castes,\\nand to unite the members of both these units\\nin one great common aim.\\n26th August, 1942.\\nIndian Legion took its oath and with that,\\nNetaji was almost successful in \\nfulfilling his goals in Germany.\\nExcept for one thing,\\nThe Axis powers were still\\nnot declaring India as independent yet.\\nThe reason was Hitler\\'s negative attitude towards Indians.\\nA few months ago, in May 1942,\\nSubhash Chandra Bose managed to meet Adolf Hitler.\\nAfter this meeting,\\nNetaji was convinced that Hitler was \\nmore interested in propaganda victories\\nas compared to actually winning with military strength.\\nThat\\'s why Netaji turned his attention towards Japan.\\nTill then, news had already reached Japan\\nthat an army of Indians was being formed in Germany\\nto oust the British from of India.\\nJapanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo had taken note of it.\\nSince early 1942, he had been saying that\\nit was time for Indians to stand up against British rule.\\nIf you want to know about the World War II stories in detail,\\nthere are many audiobooks for that on KUKU FM.\\nLike this one on Joseph Stalin,\\nthe leader of the Soviet Union during World War II.\\nOr this one on Alan Turing,\\na genius who cracked the German code\\nand helped the British in this world

side in Singapore,\\nafter Japan\\'s takeover, became Japan\\'s prisoners of war.\\nHere, Netaji saw another opportunity.\\nWhy not include those people in his army too?\\nIn the midst of all this, in August 1942,\\nMahatma Gandhi announced the Quit India Movement.\\nIn India, hundreds of thousands of people\\nwere ready for the revolution against the British government.\\nWhen this news reached Netaji,\\nhe was happy to hear it.\\nThrough Azad Hind Radio, he sent his message\\nthat all Indians should support Gandhi ji.\\nHe called the movement India\\'s non-violent guerilla warfare.\\nEven though a few years ago, there were \\ndisagreements in Gandhi ji and Netaji\\'s views.\\nTheir opinions often clashed.\\nBut at this point in time,\\nthey supported each other.\\nOn 31st August 1942,\\nwhen Netaji found out that people like \\nSavarkar and Jinnah\\nwere against the Quit India Movement,\\nthis is what he had to say on Azad Hind Radio.\\n\"I would request Mr Jinnah and Mr Savarkar\\nand all those leaders who still \\nthink of a compromise with the Britishers,\\nTo realize for once and all\\nthat in the world of tomorrow \\nthere would be no British Empire.\\nHe addressed leaders like Jinnah and Savarkar\\nand told them that there was no future for the British Empire.\\nThe last time Gandhi ji and Netaji met in person was in 1940.\\nIn that meeting, Gandhi ji told Netaji,\\nthat if Netaji\\'s could successfully free India, \\nthe first telegram congratulating \\nhim would be from Gandhi ji.\\nThis incident was written by Netaji \\nin his book, The Indian Struggle.\\nThough, their ideologies and ways were different,\\nthey greatly admired each other.\\nGandhi ji was fighting in India\\nand Netaji was fighting from outside India.\\n8th February 1943,\\nNetaji appointed his friend ACN Nambiar in charge \\nof the Indian Legion and Azad Hind Centre.\\nAnd he left Germany to head towards Japan.\\nThis time, he didn\\'t take a land route.\\nInstead, he dove into the water,\\nin a German submarine.\\nU-180 German Submarine.\\nOnce again, he changed his disguise\\nand become Mr. Matsuda.\\nI had talked about this story at the beginning of the video.\\nBy the way, he was not the only Indian to sit in the submarine.\\nHe was accompanied by another leader of the Indian Legion,\\nAbid Hasan Safrani.\\nTwo and a half months later, on the coast of Madagascar,\\nboth of them changed the submarine\\nand were welcomed in the Japanese submarine.\\nOn May 8th, 1943,\\nthis submarine reached Sabang,\\nwhich is part of present-day Indonesia.\\nFrom there, they took a flight to Tokyo\\nand on May 16th, they reached Japan.\\nNetaji met with the Japanese Prime Minister, Tojo twice.\\nThe first time was on 10th June and the second on 14th June.\\nIn their second meeting, Netaji openly asked him,\\nif Japan would help the Indian independence movement unconditionally?\\nHe wanted to confirm that\\nJapan would help India with no strings attached.\\nIn Germany, Hitler did not agree to this \\neven after months of effort,\\nbut this one question was enough in Japan.\\nTojo immediately agreed to help Netaji.\\nJapan\\'s support was public for the entire world to see.\\nTwo days later, on 16th June, Bose attended the \\n82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet.\\nAnd there, Prime Minister Tojo gave a historic address.\\n\"India has been for centuries under England\\'s rule.\"\\nHe joined India\\'s aspiration for complete independence.\\nHe claimed that Japan would do everything possible\\nto help Indian independence.\\n\"I am convinced the day of Indian freedom \\nand prosperity is not far off.\"\\nAfter this, Subhash Chandra Bose gave a statement\\nwhich was recorded on video.\\nWe have very few real video footage of Netaji.\\nThis is one of them.\\nHave a look.\\nThere was another freedom fighter in Japan \\nwho invited Subhash Chandra Bose\\nRash Behari Bose.\\nHere, I would like to tell you an interesting fact\\nthat he was actually the leader of the \\nIndian National Army at this point in time.\\nYou might be thinking, how could this be possible?\\nThe INA was made by Netaji,\\nbut no.\\nThe INA actually existed even before Netaji went to Japan.\\nThe first Indian National Army was actually formed by\\nGeneral Mohan Singh in February 1942,\\nwhen Singapore fell into the hands of Japan.\\nThis INA operated till December 1942,\\nafter which Mohan Singh disbanded this army\\nbecause of disputes with the Japanese.\\nThe reason was that the Japanese wanted\\nthe Indian National Army to fight on their behalf in Southeast Asia.\\nJust like the British made them their pawns.\\nMany Indians refused to do this\\nand so those units were shut down\\nand Mohan Singh was taken into custody by the Japanese.\\nThis is where Rash Behari Bose entered the narrative.\\nHe acted as a leader and stoped \\nthe INA from completely disbanding.\\nWith Rash Behari Bose, Subhash Chandra \\nBose reached Singapore on 2nd July\\nand were warmly welcomed with garlands.\\nRam Singh Thakuri played a song when they came out of the plane.\\nYou can watch another original video here.\\n\"The one India is proud of,\\nthe pride of India is here.\\nSubhash is the life of India.\\nSubhash is the pride of India.\\nSubhash ji, Subhash ji,\\nhe is the life of India.\"\\nAnd here, the command of the \\nremaining INA was given to Netaji.\\nThis was a very historic moment because\\nmany Indians had gathered in Singapore\\'s Padang\\nto listen to Netaji.\\nHere, he gave an inspiring speech.\\nA speech where he used the slogan \\'Chalo Dilli\\'. \\n[Let\\'s March To Delhi]\\n[Victory to Subhash Chandra Bose]\\nThere were around 13,000 soldiers in \\nthe Indian National Army in Singapore.\\nNetaji\\'s plan was to first expand the army.\\nHe wanted to gather 50,000 soldiers first.\\nAnd later, to form a strong army of \\n3 million people.\\nThe Japanese government was shocked to hear this plan.\\nThey said that they could not \\nprovide weapons to so many people.\\nThey could provide weapons to about 30,000 people only.\\nBut for Netaji, this was not \\na fight to be fought with weapons only.\\nHe wanted that eventually,\\nthe average citizens of the nation should be a part of his army.\\nAnd then, together, the Indians would overthrow the British.\\nThere were similarities between this faction \\nand the Indian Legion in Germany.\\nThe soldiers in INA were from various religious backgrounds,\\nbut there was no discrimination among them.\\nThe motto of the Indian National Army \\nwas made up of three Urdu words:\\nIttefaq, Itmaad, and Qurbani\\nwhich means Unity, Faith, and Sacrifice.\\nIn total, the INA was divided into five regiments\\nand these five regiments were named\\nafter five freedom fighters.\\nGandhi, Nehru,\\nMaulana Azad, Subhash,\\nand Rani of Jhansi.\\nEven the campaign poster of the INA\\nwhich had the phrase, Chalo Dilli,\\nhad a photo of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.\\nOn another poster, there were quotes from both \\nSubhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi.\\nBut today, there are people who\\nspread fake news on WhatsApp to show that\\nthese two opposed each other.\\nOn 7th August 1943,\\nNetaji clearly said in a radio address,\\neven though Gandhi supported non-violence,\\nhe was ready to give his full support to the Indian National Army.\\nAnd more significant than this was the fact that\\nGandhi\\'s followers would also support them.\\nOn 2nd October 1943,\\nNetaji gave another message to Gandhi ji through the radio.\\nHe said that Mahatma Gandhi\\'s services to India\\nwere unique and unparalleled,\\nthat his name should be written in \\ngold in our national history, forever.\\nNo single person could achieve as much in their life\\nunder those circumstances,\\nas much as Gandhi had achieved.\\nGandhiji reciprocated Netaji\\'s admiration\\nby giving him the title of Prince of the Patriots.\\nOn 21st August 1943,\\nNetaji set up the Provisionary Government \\nof Azad Hind in Singapore.\\nHe became the head of this provincial government.\\nHe said that it was not a normal government,\\nthat their mission was unique.\\nThey were a fighting organization\\nand they planned to declare war against the British government.\\n\"The skies reverberated with full throated shouts of\\nJai Hind!\"\\nBy then, Netaji did not have any territory,\\nbut the Indian diaspora living in South East Asia,\\nwas officially under his jurisdiction.\\nThe government established in Singapore \\nhad the right to collect taxes,\\nenforce laws and even\\nrecruit soldiers for their army.\\nTwo months later, in December 1943,\\nthe Japanese army successfully expelled \\nthe British from Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\\nThe Japanese government handed over total \\ncontrol of this territory to Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nThis became the first Indian territory\\nto be freed from the British Empire.\\nOn 30th December 1943,\\nthe national Tricoloured flag was hoisted in \\nPort Blair by Subhash Chandra Bose.\\nIn 1944, his provisional government signed \\nan Indo-Japanese loan agreement with Japan.\\nIn the negotiations, he insisted that\\nIndia was not Japan\\'s client,\\nbut a temporarily weak, co-equal government and army.\\nAccording to this, Japan gave a loan of 100 million yen to India,\\nbut Netaji used only 10 million yen.\\nOn 7th January 1944,\\nNetaji relocated the headquarters of the \\nprovincial government from Singapore\\nto Rangoon, Burma.\\nHe was very close to India.\\nThe next target was to capture Imphal and Kohima.\\nIn March 1944, an offensive began there.\\nIt was one of the toughest land battles of World War II.\\nThis battle lasted for 4.5 months,\\nfrom 3rd March 1944\\nto 18th July 1944.\\nAround 100,000 INA and Japanese soldiers were fighting on one side,\\nand on the other side, the ones fighting on \\nbehalf of the British were Indian as well,\\nthose in the British Indian Army.\\nInitially, INA was quite successful.\\nIndian Flag was hoisted in Manipur\\'s Moirang.\\nThis was the first tricolour hoisting on the Indian mainland.\\nBut soon, things started falling apart.\\nNetaji\\'s entire plan was rained upon.\\nIn May that year,\\nthe rainy season had arrived early.\\nBecause of this, it was difficult to fight in the rain and mud.\\nOn the other hand, the Japanese Army was \\nlosing against America in the Pacific Ocean.\\nSo, INA forces did not have substantial air cover.\\nThe British had a crucial advantage.\\nThe British ships attacked the supply lines.\\nFood rations were running low.\\nThe INA soldiers and the Japanese soldiers there\\nhad to eat grass and wild flowers to survive.\\n6th July 1944.\\nIt had been two years since Gandhi was released from jail.\\nNetaji broadcast an address on the radio,\\n\"Father of our nation,\\nIn this holy war for India\\'s liberation,\\nwe ask for your blessings and good wishes.\"\\nThis was the first time Gandhi ji was \\naddressed as the Father of the Nation.\\nThis is where this title comes from.\\nThis title was not given by no other than\\nSubhash Chandra Bose himself.\\n10th July 1944,\\nthe Japanese informed Netaji that\\nhis military position cannot be defended.\\nThere is no other option other than retreating.\\nAfter the failure of the Imphal attack,\\nthe INA troops marched back to Burma.\\nOn 21st August 1944,\\nNetaji publicly acknowledged \\nthe failure of the Imphal campaign.\\nHe said that due to the quick arrival of the rainy season\\nand the defects in the supply system,\\nthey had to face setbacks.\\nAfter this, Netaji returned to Singapore\\nand tried to rebuild the INA.\\nWhat happened next?\\nHow was this movement continued?\\nWhat else did Netaji do?\\nAnd what was the important role played by the soldiers of INA\\nlater in India\\'s independence?\\nLet\\'s talk about these\\nin the next part of this video.\\nBecause this video has become too long.\\nFor now, if you liked the video,\\nyou can go and watch the Quit India Movement video.\\nBecause the story in this video played out outside India\\nfrom 1942 to 1944.\\nBut what was going on in India at that time?\\nWhat were the rest of the freedom fighters doing?\\nI have talked about all these in this video.\\nYou can click here to watch it.\\nThank you very much!', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}',
